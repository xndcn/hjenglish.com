It used to represent the one time of year when getting on with the work was put on hold while enormous quantities of management hours were spent in the earnest ritual of rating and ranking performance. Now the practice is even more frequent. This of course makes it all the more important how appraisal is conducted. Human resources professionals claim that managers should strive for objectivity and thus for feedback rather than judgement. But the simple fact of the matter is that the nature of hierarchy distorts the concept of feedback because performance measure are conceived hierarchically. Unfortunately, all too many workers suffer from the injustices that this generates.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>B</b></p>\n<p>\n\tThe notion behind performance appraisal- that workers should be held accountable for their performance-is plausible. However, the evidence suggests that the premise is wrong. Contrary to assumptions appraisal is not an effective means of performance improvement- it is judgement imposed rather than feedback, a judgement imposed by the hierarchy. Useful feedback , on the other hand, would be information that told both the manager and worker how well the work system functioned, and suggested ways to make it better.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>C</b></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;Within the production system at the car manufacturer Toyota, there is nothing that is recognizable as performance appraisal. Every operation in the system has an associated measure. The measure has been worked out between the operators and their manager. In every case, the measure is related to the purpose of the work. That measure is the basis of feedback to the manager and worker alike. Toyota's basic idea is expressed in the axiom &quot;bad news first&quot; . Both managers and workers are psychologically safe in the knowledge that it is the system- not the worker -that is the primary influence on performance. It is management's responsibility to ensure that the workers operate in a system that facilitates their performance.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>D</b></p>\n<p>\n\t<b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">In many companies , performance appraisal springs from misguided as assumptions. To judge achievement, managers use date about each worker's activity, not an evaluation of the process or system's achievement of purpose. The result is that performance appraisal involves managers' judgement overruling their staff's, ignoring the true influences on performance. Thus the appraisal experience becomes a question of pleasing the boss, particularly in meetings, which is psychologically unsafe and socially driven, determining who is &quot;in&quot; and who is &quot; out&quot;.</span></b></p>\n<p>\n\t<b>E</b></p>\n<p>\n\t<b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">When judgement is replaced by feedback in the true sense, organizations will have a lot more time to devote to their customers and their business. No time will be wasted in appraisal . This requires a fundamental shift in the way we think about the organization of performance appraisals, which almost certainly will not be forthcoming from the human resources profession.</span></b></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p104551/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p104551/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p104551\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775666/\">2020东京奥运会新会徽遭狂喷：这不是桌布吗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p776058/\">2016奥巴马白宫记者晚宴演讲：33分钟段子机</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p774998/\">励志：认真看待自己，才会得到他人的尊重</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775763/\">老外说：看美剧学英语用这3招才好</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775500/\">关于节日词汇，你了解多少？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775976/\">Quora精选合集：74条经典而实用的工作经验</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p538494/\">BEC口语：没有搭档口语怎么练？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775784/\">BBC：全球最贵的东西 350亿美元的是啥？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775981/\">《权力的游戏》追剧笔记S06E02：虚拟语气</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p776039/\">六级听力场景600词（十五）</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

They&rsquo;re just new in the business and we were impressed as they promised they would deliver the goods we wanted within 2 days and they did. We had to pay more than we would have liked but the results were worth it. Since then, I&rsquo;ve told a lot of other people about them.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t解析：<br />\n\t关键句：they promised they would deliver the goods we wanted within 2 days and they did. 可见，本段强调的重点是两天的承诺，速度快，于是选择G.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t19.<br />\n\tWoman: Apparently they&rsquo;re an established company in Scotland with an excellent reputation, but I didn&rsquo;t know that at the time. I found them through the Internet. I was just browsing through the list of suppliers one day and I noticed their name. I looked them up and found that they had this fantastic discount available that particular month. We ordered various things and the quality was so good we&rsquo;ve continued using them.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t解析：<br />\n\t关键句：they had this fantastic discount available that particular month. 强调的重点是非常可观的折扣.虽然大家会在原文中听到excellent reputation，但是要注意的是 but I didn&rsquo;t know that at the time.这句话，这位女生那个时候并不知道这家公司，于是大家不要刚刚听到一个选项中出现的词就匆忙作出选择。根据全文，于是应该选择E.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t20.<br />\n\tMan: We like to try out different suppliers to make sure we&rsquo;re always getting the best deal. This particular company was running a big publicity campaign. I&rsquo;d seen the ads on TV and they really put me off. I just couldn&rsquo;t see the appeal. But then someone I met at a training day told me we should use them. His company had used their service for years with no complains so we followed his advice.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t解析：<br />\n\t关键句：someone I met at a training day told me we should use them.看到了吧，熟人的推荐永远占先机呢。要注意的是虽然文中出现This particular company was running a big publicity campaign. I&rsquo;d seen the ads on TV这句话，可是呢，要注意朗读者之后说出they really put me off. 这些宣传让他很失望，因此千万不要选A，于是选择C.appeal to us意思是吸引我们。<br />\n\t<br />\n\t21.<br />\n\tWoman: We&rsquo;ve looked around the market to find the cheapest deal possible but to be honest there wasn&rsquo;t much to choose, in terms of cost, between any of the local suppliers. However, we had a visit from a sales representative from one company and we asked him to make up some complimentary printed letterheads for us. They were exactly what we wanted so that was the deciding factor. I think that personal touch gives a company far better results than advertising ever can.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t解析：<br />\n\t关键句：we asked him to make up some complimentary printed letterheads for us. They were exactly what we wanted so that was the deciding factor.这句话的意思是：我们要求这位供应商代表为他们免费印一些信纸。<br />\n\t<br />\n\t根据辞典，complimentary：1.given free of charge by the producer or owner （生产者或所有者给的）赠品: a complimentary seat, ticket, copy of a book 优待席﹑ 赠券﹑ 赠书.<br />\n\t2.if something is complimentary, you do not have to pay for it: FREE: All guests will receive a complimentary bottle of champagne.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t因此，该题选B.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t22.<br />\n\tMan: Obviously there are many different factors to consider when you choose a new supplier. We always used a local company because they were relatively near and we could even pick things up ourselves if necessary. But unfortunately, they just became so expensive. Now that express delivery services are widely available, distance is no longer a consideration and we&rsquo;ve been able to choose someone who can give us the best package for the lowest cost.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t解析：<br />\n\t关键句： But unfortunately, they just became so expensive. 和we&rsquo;ve been able to choose someone who can give us the best package for the lowest cost. 整段话都在强调价格方面的问题。于是，根据本段整体，于是选择H.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p104411/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p104411\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775666/\">2020东京奥运会新会徽遭狂喷：这不是桌布吗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p776058/\">2016奥巴马白宫记者晚宴演讲：33分钟段子机</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p774998/\">励志：认真看待自己，才会得到他人的尊重</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775763/\">老外说：看美剧学英语用这3招才好</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775500/\">关于节日词汇，你了解多少？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775976/\">Quora精选合集：74条经典而实用的工作经验</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p538494/\">BEC口语：没有搭档口语怎么练？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775784/\">BBC：全球最贵的东西 350亿美元的是啥？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775981/\">《权力的游戏》追剧笔记S06E02：虚拟语气</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p776039/\">六级听力场景600词（十五）</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

In their opinions, people who change their jobs frequently are superficial and tactless. They believe that the only way to success is to stick to one job, for constant practice in a professional field helps make an expert.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are still many people who don&rsquo;t agree. They argue that change means progress. If you are not satisfied with your present job, of course you have the right to replace it with a more challenging and better paid one. Every change is a step to further success. This idea may be. the reason why they change their jobs so often.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor my part, I think it reasonable to change your job if you have a better opportunity. But once you have found a position where you can fully display your ability, it is advisable to settle down to it and put all your efforts into it. Only in this way, can you get the true joy of achieving your goal.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p776129/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p776129\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775666/\">2020东京奥运会新会徽遭狂喷：这不是桌布吗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p776058/\">2016奥巴马白宫记者晚宴演讲：33分钟段子机</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p774998/\">励志：认真看待自己，才会得到他人的尊重</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775763/\">老外说：看美剧学英语用这3招才好</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775500/\">关于节日词汇，你了解多少？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775976/\">Quora精选合集：74条经典而实用的工作经验</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p538494/\">BEC口语：没有搭档口语怎么练？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775784/\">BBC：全球最贵的东西 350亿美元的是啥？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775981/\">《权力的游戏》追剧笔记S06E02：虚拟语气</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p776039/\">六级听力场景600词（十五）</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

At the outset, on behalf of the Chinese government and people and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere welcome to the foreign ministers and representatives from CICA member states and observers and leading officials and representatives from relevant international organizations. Let me also offer my warm congratulations on the opening of the meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t这次会议是亚信外长会首次在中国举行，也是新形势下促进亚洲安全和发展、推动亚信建设的一件大事。会议以&ldquo;以对话促安全&rdquo;为主题，凝聚各方共识，促进亚洲安全，谋求共同发展，加强亚信作用，促进信任和协作。这对亚洲乃至世界安全和繁荣具有重要意义。This is the first time for China to host the CICA Foreign Ministers&rsquo; Meeting, which is an important occasion for promoting security and development in Asia and strengthening CICA&rsquo;s capacity in the new era. The meeting, under the theme of &ldquo;promoting security through dialogue&rdquo;, will help pool consensus, contribute to security in Asia, seek common development, strengthen CICA&rsquo;s role, and enhance trust and coordination among CICA members. This is of great significance to security and prosperity in Asia and beyond.</p>\n<p>\n\t当今世界正处在前所未有的历史性变革之中。和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流不可阻挡，同时我们所处的星球并不太平，维护世界和平、促进共同发展仍然任重道远。The world today is experiencing historic changes like never before. Peace, development and win-win cooperation represent an unstoppable trend of our time. That said, the planet where we live is not all tranquil. To maintain world peace and promote common development remains a long and arduous journey.</p>\n<p>\n\t在世界和平与发展进程中，亚洲具有独特而重要的地位。今天的亚洲，和平稳定是大势所趋，发展繁荣是民心所向。亚洲经济领跑全球，区域合作和一体化进程方兴未艾，亚洲在全球发展全局中的战略地位不断上升。同时，亚洲局部动荡冲突等传统安全问题仍然存在，恐怖主义等非传统安全威胁日益突出，区域安全合作亟待加强。Asia holds a uniquely important position in the pursuit of world peace and development. Today in Asia, peace and stability is the defining trend, and development and prosperity represent the common aspirations of the people. As a world leader in economic development, Asia enjoys vibrant regional cooperation and integration and rising strategic status in the global development landscape. On the other hand, some parts of our continent are still plagued by turbulence and conflicts caused by traditional security challenges while terrorism and other non-traditional security threats are posing rising dangers to Asia. The situation cries out for ever closer regional security cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\t在2014年亚信上海峰会上，我倡议树立共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，走出一条共建共享共赢的亚洲安全之路。两年来，国际和地区形势发展变化表明，维护地区安全需要大家共同努力。我们要坚持和践行亚洲安全观，凝聚共识，促进对话，加强协作，推动构建具有亚洲特色的安全治理模式，共创亚洲和平与繁荣的美好未来。为此，我们要重点在以下方面作出努力。At the CICA Summit in Shanghai in 2014, I proposed a vision on common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security in Asia and called for joint efforts to explore an inclusive and win-win approach to Asian security that is for all and by all. Developments in the region and the world over the past two years show that it takes concerted efforts to uphold regional security. We need to adhere to and follow through the vision on Asian security, build consensus, step up dialogue and coordination, contribute to the fostering of a security governance model with Asian features, and open up a brighter future of peace and prosperity for Asia. To this end, we need to focus our endeavor in the following areas:</p>\n<p>\n\t第一，把握方向，构建亚洲命运共同体。亚洲各国安危与共、命运相系。我们要发展合作共赢的新型伙伴关系，相互尊重，平等相待，守望相助，同舟共济，在追求本国利益时兼顾各国合理关切，在谋求本国发展时促进各国共同发展，在维护本国安全时尊重各国安全，一起来促进地区和平、稳定、繁荣。我们要深化军事政治、新威胁新挑战、经济、人文、环保等领域安全和信任措施建设合作，共同为亚洲安全和发展撑起一片蓝天。First, keep to the direction of building an Asian community of common future. Countries in Asia share weal and woe and the future of our nations is closely tied with each other. We need to develop a new type of partnership featuring win-win cooperation and live together in the spirit of mutual respect, equality, mutual assistance and solidarity. We should accommodate reasonable concerns of others while pursuing our own interests, promote common development while seeking our own development, respect security of others while safeguarding our own security, and join hands in advancing peace, stability and prosperity in the region. We need to deepen security cooperation and confidence-building in military, political, economic, people-to-people, cultural, environmental protection and other fields as well as in tackling emerging threats and challenges, so as to open up new prospects for security and development in Asia.</p>\n<p>\n\t第二，夯实基础，推动不同文明交流互鉴。亚洲民族、宗教、文化多样，社会制度、发展道路、经济发展水平各异，对有关安全问题的认知和关切不尽相同。在这样的情况下，我们要加强交流、加强沟通，把亚洲多样性转化为扩大交流合作的动力，推动不同文明包容互鉴、共同发展，为维护地区和平稳定发挥作用。各方可以通过参与亚洲文明对话大会等平台和手段，汇聚智慧和力量，为地区安全综合治理营造更加深厚的基础。Second, cement the foundation for exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations. Asia is home to a diversity of nations, religions and cultures, and countries vary in social system, development path and economic development level. Our perceptions and concerns on relevant security issues may not always be the same. Given such a reality, we need to scale up exchanges and communication and turn the diversity of Asia into an impetus for more exchanges and cooperation, and facilitate inclusiveness, mutual learning and common development of different civilizations, to make joint contribution to maintaining regional peace and stability. We can together explore channels and platforms, such as an Asia Civilization Dialogue Conference to pool wisdom and strength and solidify the foundation for comprehensive regional security governance.</p>\n<p>\n\t第三，互谅互让，坚持对话协商和平解决争议。&ldquo;恃德者昌，恃力者亡。&rdquo;弱肉强食有违时代潮流，穷兵黩武缔造不了和平，互谅互让才能带来稳定，坚守道义才能赢得持久安全。我们要坚持通过对话协商，依据国际法，坚持以和平方式解决争议问题，以对话增互信，以对话解纷争，以对话促安全。针对复杂的地区热点问题，有关各方要保持冷静、坚守和平，避免采取使局势升级的行动，通过建立规则机制管控危机，通过增进互信缓和紧张，通过政治手段化解危机，逐步推动问题解决。Third, uphold mutual understanding and mutual accommodation and peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and consultation. As a Chinese adage reads, &ldquo;he who cherishes virtue prospers and he who favors might perishes.&rdquo; The law of the jungle goes against the trend of the time and belligerence cannot lead to peace. Only mutual understanding and mutual accommodation will bring about stability and only commitment to justice can ensure lasting security. We need to uphold peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and consultation in accordance with international law. We need to enhance trust, resolve disagreements and promote security through dialogue. Faced with complex regional hotspot issues, relevant parties need to stay calm and commit to peace, refrain from taking actions that may escalate the situation, promote crisis management through rules-making, and de-escalate tension by strengthening mutual trust, with a view to defusing crisis through political means and promoting gradual resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\t第四，循序渐进，探讨建立符合地区特点的安全架构。亚洲存在多个安全合作机制，在维护地区安全方面都发挥着一定作用。我们要坚持和发扬亚洲国家长期以来形成的相互尊重、协商一致、照顾各方舒适度的亚洲方式，加强地区各项安全机制协调，围绕彼此一致或相近目标逐步开展合作，形成合力，求得实效。在此基础上，可以逐步探讨构建符合亚洲特点的地区安全合作新架构。亚信非政府论坛等平台可以就此进行研讨，就地区安全合作的原则、重点方向等提出设想和建议。Fourth, gradually explore the building of a security architecture that fits regional conditions. There exist multiple security cooperation frameworks in Asia, and they all contribute to regional security in their own way. Asian countries have long cherished the Asian way of mutual respect, consensus-building and accommodation of each other&rsquo;s comfort levels. We should uphold and promote this approach, strengthen coordination among regional security frameworks, and gradually channel cooperation toward the same or similar goals to create synergy and work for practical results. On such basis, we may explore the building of a new architecture of regional security cooperation that reflects Asian needs. We can discuss relevant matters at such platforms as the CICA Non-governmental Forum and put forward ideas and suggestions on the principles and priorities of regional security cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\t当今世界，合作潮流浩浩荡荡，包容理念深入人心。亚洲国家和人民有能力更有需要通过对话和合作维护亚洲安全和发展环境。亚洲一贯具有开放包容的传统，也拥有登高望远的智慧。我们欢迎域外国家为亚洲和平与发展贡献正能量，同亚洲国家一起促进亚洲安全稳定和发展繁荣。亚洲稳定了、发展了，对世界有利；亚洲混乱了、衰落了，对世界不利。这是近代以来亚洲历史告诉人们的一个深刻道理。People around the world yearn for cooperation and inclusiveness. And countries and peoples in Asia have the ability and see the pressing need to maintain a sound environment of security and development in Asia through dialogue and cooperation. Asians are known to be open, inclusive and visionary. We welcome countries outside the region making positive contribution to peace and stability here and working with Asian countries to promote security, stability, development and prosperity of Asia. A stable and developing Asia is a blessing, while a turbulent and declining Asia would bring nothing but trouble to the world. This is a profound lesson drawn from modern Asian history.</p>\n<p>\n\t女士们、先生们、朋友们！<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,</span></p>\n<p>\n\t中国奉行和平外交政策，提出并带头践行共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，始终是国际和地区安全的维护者、建设者、贡献者。中国坚定不移走和平发展道路，坚定不移维护以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为核心的国际秩序，坚定不移推动构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，致力于打造人类命运共同体。长期以来，中国同国际社会一道，共同应对国际和地区安全风险、挑战、危机，作出了积极贡献。China follows a foreign policy of peace. We proposed and have taken the lead in practicing a new Asian approach of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and have worked all along to uphold, promote and contribute to international and regional security. China is firmly committed to pursuing the peaceful development path, maintaining the international order with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter at its core, fostering a new type of international relations of win-win cooperation, and building a community of shared future for all mankind. Over the years, China has worked together with the international community to tackle security risks, challenges and crises in the region and beyond, and have made positive contributions along the way.</p>\n<p>\n\t世界关注亚洲，亚洲影响世界。当前，涉及亚洲安全形势的一些热点问题受到国际社会高度关注，中国为推动这些问题解决作出了积极努力。The world cares about Asia, and what happens in Asia impacts the whole world. Some security hotspots in Asia have recently caught the international limelight, and China has made great efforts towards their resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\t今年年初以来，朝鲜半岛局势持续紧张。中国为管控形势、推动各方对话谈判付出巨大努力。我们坚持朝鲜半岛无核化，坚持维护半岛和平稳定，坚持通过对话协商解决问题。作为联合国安理会常任理事国，中国全面完整执行联合国安理会有关决议。作为半岛近邻，我们决不允许半岛生战生乱，一旦发生这样的情况对谁都没有好处。希望各方保持克制，不要相互刺激和激化矛盾，而是要共同努力，把半岛核问题早日拉回到对话谈判解决的轨道，推动实现东北亚长治久安。The situation on the Korean Peninsula has been tense since the beginning of the year. China has made huge efforts to manage the situation and push for dialogue and negotiation among various parties. We are committed to denuclearization, to peace and stability on the Peninsula, and to the resolution of issues through dialogue and consultation. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has implemented relevant Security Council resolutions fully and faithfully. As a close neighbor, we will never allow war or chaos on the Peninsula, as this serves nobody&rsquo;s interests. We hope that various parties will exercise restraint, avoid mutual provocation and escalation of tension, make joint efforts to bring the nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue and negotiation as early as possible, and work toward peace and security in Northeast Asia.</p>\n<p>\n\t阿富汗正处于关键转型期，面临多方面挑战，需要国际社会大力支持。中国积极参与阿富汗问题伊斯坦布尔进程，支持阿富汗和平重建，支持&ldquo;阿人主导，阿人所有&rdquo;的包容性政治和解进程。中国真诚希望阿富汗早日实现和平、稳定、发展，愿同国际社会一道，继续为阿富汗和平重建、政治和解、顺利转型提供支持和帮助。Afghanistan is undergoing a crucial phase of transition. Confronted with challenges on multiple fronts, it needs strong support of the international community. China has taken an active part in the Istanbul Process on Afghanistan, and worked hard to support peaceful reconstruction as well as the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process of inclusive political reconciliation. We sincerely hope to see an early restoration of peace, stability and development in Afghanistan. We will, together with the international community, continue to support peace and reconstruction, political reconciliation and smooth transition in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\t叙利亚、巴以等问题早日解决既符合当事各方利益，也是国际社会共同期盼。中国历来主张通过政治谈判推动有关问题和平解决，一直以各种方式积极劝和促谈，并将会继续为此作出努力。中国为伊朗核问题全面协议的达成发挥了建设性作用，愿同各方一道，继续推动全面协议的后续执行。An early settlement of the Syrian issue and Palestine-Israel issue serves the interests of parties concerned and represents the common aspiration of the international community. China has always called for the peaceful settlement of relevant issues through political negotiations, actively promoted talks and reconciliation through various means, and will continue to make efforts in this direction. China played a constructive role in the conclusion of the comprehensive agreement of the Iranian nuclear issue. We will work with other parties to ensure continuous progress in its implementation.</p>\n<p>\n\t一段时间以来，各方都很关心南海问题。我想强调，中国一贯致力于维护南海地区和平稳定，坚定维护自身在南海的主权和相关权利，坚持通过同直接当事国友好协商谈判和平解决争议。中方愿同东盟国家一道努力，将南海建设成为和平之海、友谊之海、合作之海。For some time, developments in the South China Sea have attracted extensive attention. Let me stress that China is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea. We firmly stand by our sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea, and remain committed to resolving disputes peacefully through friendly consultation and negotiation with countries directly concerned. We will continue to work with ASEAN countries to make the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\t女士们、先生们、朋友们！<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,</span></p>\n<p>\n\t自2014年接任亚信主席国以来，中国认真履行职责，推进亚信各领域对话合作，取得积极成果。未来两年，中国将连任主席国，愿同各方一道推动亚信在地区安全和发展事务中发挥更大作用。在此，我谨对各方对中方主席国工作的大力支持和配合，表示衷心的感谢！Since taking over the CICA presidency in 2014, China has earnestly performed its duties and endeavored to advance fruitful dialogue and cooperation across the board. In the next two years of our new term, we will work with other parties to raise CICA&rsquo;s profile in regional security and development affairs. Here, I would like to express heartfelt thanks to all of you for your great support for China&rsquo;s presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\t当前，中国人民正在为实现全面建成小康社会奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而团结奋斗。中国发展将继续为各国创造更多机遇、给各国民众带来更多福祉。中国人民将在追求中国梦的过程中帮助和支持各国人民实现各自的美好梦想，一道实现持久和平、共同繁荣的亚洲梦，共创亚洲美好未来！The Chinese people are making united efforts to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and fulfill the Chinese dream of great renewal of the Chinese nation. China&rsquo;s development will bring more opportunities and benefits to all countries and peoples. While pursuing the Chinese dream, the Chinese people will support people from other countries in realizing their own dreams, so that together, we will make the Asian dream of enduring peace and common prosperity come true and open up a great future for Asia.</p>\n<p>\n\t最后，预祝本次会议取得圆满成功！In conclusion, I wish this meeting a complete success.</p>\n<p>\n\t谢谢大家。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Thank you.</span></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p775744/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p775744\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775666/\">2020东京奥运会新会徽遭狂喷：这不是桌布吗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p774998/\">励志：认真看待自己，才会得到他人的尊重</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775500/\">关于节日词汇，你了解多少？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775784/\">BBC：全球最贵的东西 350亿美元的是啥？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775730/\">秘鲁女学生用身体为流浪狗挡雨 感动了世界</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p538494/\">BEC口语：没有搭档口语怎么练？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775981/\">《权力的游戏》追剧笔记S06E02：虚拟语气</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p772002/\">10秒内可捡起掉在地上的食物吃？！别再信啦</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p775976/\">Quora精选合集：74条经典而实用的工作经验</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p768320/\">自省时间：害怕被吐槽？那就别再吐槽别人了</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

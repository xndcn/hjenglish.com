Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>范文：</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI like the idea of students having several short vacations throughout the year. I&rsquo;m a working parent with two school-age children. Every summer I have to come up with a plan for keeping my children safe and entertained for three months, while my husband and I are at work. Summer camps are expensive, and finding the one your children will enjoy can be a challenge. Getting rid of that one long vacation would make life a lot easier.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving several shorter vacations would also make it easier to schedule vacations. My husband and I both work in small offices with other working parents. All of us need vacation time during the same three months. This is hard on our businesses and our careers.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also find that wherever we go in the summer, it&rsquo;s crowded. It would be nice to go places throughout the year and find smaller crowds. I&rsquo;m sure the attractions themselves would like that better, too. It would be better for the economy to spread things out, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think my children would be more focused on their students if their vacation time was divided up throughout the year. The final month of the school year, they&rsquo;re just not paying attention. They&rsquo;ve been in school for nine long months and they don&rsquo;t have a lot of energy. Plus , they&rsquo;re anticipating vacation time. If vacations were throughout the year, they would concentrate better on studies.<br />\n\tOf course, many older school buildings aren&rsquo;t air-conditioned, because usually people aren&rsquo;t there during the hottest months. That might be a problem, I think, though, that new air-conditioning would be worth the cost. During the last few weeks of summer, my children are bored with their long vacation. I doubt that would happen if there were several vacations throughout the year.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p815630/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p815630\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p813954/\">男票男票速来学习，博得女孩芳心的10大窍门</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p813935/\">清奇的动物界：萌翻你的高难度瑜伽姿势</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p807835/\">致大学新生：学长给你的20条入学建议</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p807011/\">时间胶囊：我想告诉年轻时的自己</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p813950/\">苹果党辣么喜欢撩拨Siri，可TA为啥叫Siri？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p788798/\">为什么会外语的人薪水更高？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p811200/\">马云全英文演讲谈杭州和G20，高端中国英语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p812765/\">Twitter健身计划：10条认真的健身小贴士</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p812611/\">BBC英语教学 Shedloads 大量，许多</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p805894/\">中了这8条？那你友谊的小船要翻了</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

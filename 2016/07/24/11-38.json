The Finns have perfected the steam bath, or sauna, which may be taken, usually in an enclosed room, by pouring water over hot rocks or as a dry heat bath._____(46)Dry heat and steam baths had advocates in ancient Rome and pre-Columbian Americans used sweat lodges.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　The earliest saunas were probably underground caves heated by a fire that naturally filled with smoke as chimney making was unknown at that time. A fire kept in a fire-pit would heat the rock walls of the cave. After reaching full heat, the smoke was let out of the cave and the stones would retain heat for several hours._____(47)Today most saunas use electric stoves, although gas and wood-burning stoves are available.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Saunas are relaxing and stress relieving. Those with muscle aches or arthritis(关节炎)may find that the heat relaxes muscles and relieves pain and inflammation(炎症). Asthma(气喘)patients find that the heat enlarges air passageways of the lung and facilitates breathing. Saunas do not cure the common cold but they may help to alleviate congestion(阻塞)arid speed recovery time._____(48)The sauna could be considered to follow the old saying &quot;feed a cold, starve a fever&quot;. The regular use of a sauna may decrease the likelihood of getting a cold in the first place.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Sauna is good for your skin as the blood flow to the skin increases and sweating occurs. Adults sweat about 2 lbs of water per hour on average in a sauna. A good sweat removes dirt and grime from pores and gives the skin a healthy glow. The loss in water weight is temporary as the body's physiological mechanisms will quickly restore proper volumes._____(49)Heart rate may increase from 72 beats per minute on average to 100-150 beats per minute.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A normal heart can handle these stresses but those with heart trouble wishing to begin to use a sauna should seek a doctor's advice. The elderly and those with diabetes should check with their doctor prior to beginning to take saunas._____(50)Indeed, everyone just starting out should take short sessions at first to become accustomed to this type of bath.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　46.【题干】_____</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.an extra large sauna and steam room can be used for players to relax

  "description": "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t阅读理解</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tDon&rsquo;t count on dung</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Conservationists (自然保护主义者) may be miscalculating the numbers of the threatened animals such as elephants, say African and American researchers. The error　occurs because of a flaw in the way they estimate animal numbers from the piles of dung (粪) the creatures leave behind.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　The mistake could lead researchers to think that there are twice as many elephants as there really are in some regions, according to Andrew Plumptre of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in New York.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Biologist Katy Payne of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, agrees. &quot;We really need to know elephant numbers and the evidence that we have is quite indirect,&quot; says Payne, who electronically tracks elephants.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Counting elephants from planes is impossible in the vast rainforests of Central Africa. So researchers often estimate elephant numbers by counting dung piles in a given area. They also need to know the rate at which dung decays: Because it's extremely difficult to determine these rates, however, researchers counting elephants in one region tend to rely on standard decay rates established elsewhere.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　But researchers at the WCS have found that this decay rate varies from region to region depending on the climate and environment. Using the wrong values can lead the census astray (离开正道), says Plumptre.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　He and his colleague Anthony Chifu Nchanji studied decaying elephant dung in the forests of Cameroon. They found that the dung decayed between 55 and 65 per cent</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　more slowly than the dung in the rainforests of neighbouring Gabon. If researchers use decay rates from Gabon to count elephants in Cameroon, they would probably find more elephants than are actually around.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　This could mean estimates in Cameroon are at least twice as high as those derived from decay rates calculated locally, says Plumptre. &quot;However accurate your dung density estimate might be, the decay rate can severely affect the result.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Plumptre also says that the dung-pile census should be carried out over a region similar in size to an elephant's natural range. The usual technique of monitoring only small, protected areas distorts numbers because elephants move in and out of these regions, he says. &quot;If the elephant population increases within the protected area, you can not determine whether it is a real increase or whether it is due to elephants moving in because they are being poached (入侵偷猎) outside.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Plumptre says that similar problems may also affect other animal census studies that rely on indirect evidence such as nests, tracks or burrows (地洞).</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　1　The word &quot;threatened&quot; in the first sentence of the first paragraph could be best replaced by</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A &quot;endangered&quot;.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B &quot;frightened&quot;.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C &quot;killed&quot;.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D &quot;angered&quot;.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　2　Why do researchers estimate elephant numbers in an area by counting dung piles?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A Because elephants are difficult to catch.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B Because it is not possible to count elephants from a plane.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C Because it is not possible to keep track of elephants.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D Because elephants are shy animals.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　3　Piles of dung can't be relied upon when it comes to estimating elephant numbers because</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A they are different in size.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B they scatter all over the region.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C they are different in decay rate.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D they are different in quality.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　4　According to Plumptre, the region over which a dung-pile census is carried out should be</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A small enough.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B well protected.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C carefully monitored.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D large enough.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　5 The first word &quot;He&quot; in paragraph 6 refers to</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A Andrew Plumptre.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B Katy Payne.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C Anthony Chifu Nchanji.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D the writer of the article.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tBlack Holes Trigger Stars to Self-Destruct</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Scientists have long understood that supermassive black holes weighing millions or billions of suns can tear apart stars that come too close. The black hotels gravity pulls harder on the nearest part of the star, an imbalance that pulls the star apart over a period of minutes or hours, once it gets close enough.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Scientists say this Uneven pulling is not the only hazard facing the star. The strain of these unbalanced forces can also trigger a nuclear explosion powerful enough to destroy the star from within. Matthieu Brassart and Jean-Pierre Luminet of the Observatoire de Paris in Meudon, France, carried out computer simulations of the final moments of such an unfortunate star's life,as it veered towards a supermassive black hole.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　When the star gets close enough, the uneven forces flatten it into a pancake shape. Some previous studies had suggested this flattening would increase the density and temperature inside the star enough to trigger intense nuclear reactions that would tear it apart. But other studies had suggested that the picture would be complicated by shock waves generated during the flattening process and that no nuclear explosion should occur.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　The new simulations investigated the effects of shock waves in detail,and found that even when their effects are included,the conditions favor a nuclear explosion. &quot;There will be an explosion of the star-it will be completely destroyed,&quot; Brassart says. Although the explosion obliterates the star, it saves some of the star's matter from being devoured by the black hole. The explosion is powerful enough to hurl much of the star's matter out of the black hole's reach, he says.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　The devouring of stars by black holes may already have been observed, although at a much later stage. It is thought that several months after the event that rips the star apart,its matter starts swirling into the hole itself. It heats up as it does so, releasing ultraviolet light and X-rays.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　If stars disrupted near black holes really do explode, then they could in principle allow these events to be detected at a much earlier stage, says Jules Hatpern of Columbia University in New York, US. &quot;It may make it possible to see the disruption of that star immediately if it gets hot enough,&quot; he says.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Brassart agrees. &quot;Perhaps it can be observed in the X-rays and gamma rays, but it's something that needs to be more studied,&quot; he says. Supernova researcher Chris Fryer of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, US, says the deaths of these stars are difficult to simulate, and he is not sure whether the researchers have proven their case that they explode in the process.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　36.【题干】Something destructive could happen to a star that gets too close to a black hole. Which of the following destructive statements is NOT mentioned in the passage?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. The black hole could tear apart the star.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. The black hole could trigger a nuclear explosion in the star.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. The black hole could dwindle its size considerably.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. The black hole could devour the star.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　37.【题干】According to the third paragraph, researchers differed from each other in the problem of_____</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. whether nuclear reaction would occur.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. whether the stars would increase its density and temperature.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. whether shock waves would occur.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. whether the uneven forces would flatten the stars.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　38.【题干】According to the fourth paragraph, which of the following is NOT true?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. No nuclear explosion would be triggered inside the star.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. The star would be destroyed completely.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. Much of the star's matter thrown by the explosion would be beyond the black hole's reach.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. The black hole would completely devour the star.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　39.【题干】What will happen several months after the explosion of the star?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. The star's matter will move further away from by the black hole.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. The black hole&rsquo;s matter will heat up.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. The torn star's matter will swirl into the black hole.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. The black hole's matter will release ultraviolet light and X-rays.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　40.【题干】According to the context, the word &quot;disruption&quot; in Paragraph 6 means_____</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. &quot;Confusion.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. &quot;Tearing apart.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. &quot;Interruption.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. &quot;Flattening.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tSports star Yao Ming 【运动明星姚明】</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　If Yao Ming is not the biggest sports star in the world, he is almost certainly the tallest. At 2.26m, he is the tallest player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and holds the record as the most towering Olympian ever to compete in the Games.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　But what really stands out about the giant center is his celebrity(名气). Few, if any, Chinese athletes are as well-known as Yao around the world. People across the globe are fascinated with Yao, not only for his basketball prowess(杰出的才能)also for being a symbol of international commerce.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　When Yao joined the Houston Rockets as the No.1 pick in the 2002 NBA draft(选抜)， he was the first international player ever to be selected first. His assets on the court are clear enough&mdash;no NBA player of his size has ever possessed his mobility, so he is a handful(难对付的人)for opponents on either end of the court. But what makes Yao invaluable to the Rockets organization is his role as a global citizen and as a bridge to millions of potential basketball fans in China.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　When it was announced in February that Yao would miss the rest of the NBA season and possibly the Olympics with a stress fracture(骨折)in his left foot, a collective shudder(震动)spread across China. After considerable debate and discussion, Yao opted to get his foot surgically treated in an operation that placed several tiny screws across the bone, to offer his overburdened foot more support. The surgery was a success, and though the estimated four-month recovery period will leave him little time to prepare with Team China, Yao has vowed to be ready for the Beijing Olympics.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Yao wrapped up a 10-day trip to China, where he underwent a series of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments, hoping to accelerate his recovery process Western experts are generally skeptical of TCM's benefits although new research from the University of Rochester suggests that a certain compound derived from shellfish may indeed stimulate bone repair.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　&quot;There is no reason to dismiss TCM,&quot; Yao told a press conference in Beijing.&quot; It's been used in our country for thousands of years. I don't think that it's short on science.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　36.【题干】The word &quot;towering&quot; in Paragraph 1 means_____</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. large.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. fat.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. tall.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. great.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　37.【题干】Opponents find it very difficult to control Yao Ming because of his_____</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. mobility.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. assault.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. defense.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. celebrity.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　38.【题干】Yao Ming had to undergo a series of TCM treatments because_____</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. his right foot had been hurting.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. he wanted to make a more rapid recovery.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. the surgical operation had been a failure.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. he couldn't afford all the medical expenses.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　39.【题干】Which statement about Yao Ming is NOT true?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. He missed the Athens Olympics.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. He is an NBA player.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. He fractured his left foot.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D.

id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　For many young Americans, graduating from college means finding a job, moving out of the dorm room and beginning to register one's annual earnings with the US government.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　That last item is the law, though sometimes it's a hassle(难事)to obey.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Independent tax advisor Bob Gilbert calls the US income tax system &quot;amazingly complicated&quot;. But he adds that &quot;very little of the complicated tax law applies to young people who are just beginning their careers&quot;. According to Gilbert, 80 to 90 percent of Americans are not really burdened by the system's complications.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Still, all the numbers and forms can be a little confusing to those who are just starting their careers. Some pull out their calculators and try to do the math alone. Some use income tax software. Others just hand the whole responsibility over to tax firms like Gilbert's. According to income tax law expert Linda Beale, young people will often follow their parents' lead when filling their income forms.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　&quot;Young people who grow up in wealthy households typically use professional tax services because their parents have always done so,&quot; said Beale, a professor at Wayne State University in Michigan State.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　&quot;On the other hand, most poorer young people probably try to do their own taxes, unless they want a quick 'refund' with the help of a tax advisor&quot;.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　In fact, obeying the law has its benefits. For one, many young people can expect a tax refund. This means that, over the course of the year, they have paid too much in monthly federal or state taxes and are entitled to the difference.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Bob Thalman, a 20-year-old university student, expects he will get a refund of about 100, which will probably go in the bank, or perhaps be used to pay for car insurance or credit card bills.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Thalman called the whole process a &quot;hassle&quot;, but added that he didn't wat to test the law by not filling his income tax papers.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　&quot;I'm worried about what would happen if I failed to file,&quot; he said. &quot;I know one individual who did not report his income tax for many years, and he's now in federal prison. I certainly don&rsquo;t want that.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　16.【题干】A college student with a part-time job is not required to file an income tax form.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.Right</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B.Wrong</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C.Not mentioned</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　17.【题干】The US income tax system does not wholly apply to a college graduate who is just beginning his or her career.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.Right</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B.Wrong</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C.Not mentioned</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　18.【题干】It's pretty easy for a beginner to report his or her income tax.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.Right</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B.Wrong</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C.Not mentioned</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　19.【题干】When young people file their income tax form, they will often follow in their parents' footsteps.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.Right</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B.Wrong</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C.Not mentioned</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　20.【题干】Young people from poorer families needn't file their income tax forms.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.Right</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B.Wrong</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C.Not mentioned</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　21.【题干】If one has failed to report his or her income tax for quite a few years, he or she may be put in prison.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.Right</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B.Wrong</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C.Not mentioned</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　22.【题干】The US income tax system will be simplified in the next few years.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A.Right</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B.Wrong</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C.Not mentioned</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t概括大意与完成句子</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tTunguska Event</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　1 A hundred years ago this week, a giganticexplosion ripped (撕裂) open the day y above a forest in western Siberia, leaving ascientific riddle that endures to this day.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　2 A dazzling light pierced the heavens,followed by a shock wave as strong as 1,000 atomic bombs. The explosionflattened 80 million trees across an area of 2,000 square kilometers. Thefireball was so great that, a day later, Londoners could read their newspapersunder the night sky. What caused the so-called Tunguska Event, named after thenearby Podkamennaya Tunguska river, still remains a mystery.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　3 Experts suspect it was a rock that, aftertraveling in space for millions of years, was destined to crash to Earth atexactly 7:17 a.m. on June 30, 1908. This possibility worries scientists.&ldquo;Imagine an unspotted asteroid (小行星) hitting a significant chunk(块) of land ... and imagine if that area, unlike Tunguska, werepopulated,&rdquo; the British science journal Nature commented recently.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　4 But no fragments of the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; have everbeen found. Finding such evidence would be important, for it would increase ourknowledge about the risk posed by dangerous Near Earth Objects (NEOs), sayItalian researchers Luca Gasperini, Enrico Bonatti and Giuseppe Longo. When thenext Tunguska NEO approaches, scientists will have to decide whether to try todeflect (使偏转) it or blowit up in space.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　5 However, several rival theories for theTunguska Event exist. Wolfgang Kundt, a professor at Germany's Bonn University,believes the Tunguska Event was caused by a massive escape of 10 million tonsof methane(甲烷)-rich gasfrom deep within earth's crust. Some people hold that the explosion was causedby an alien spaceship crash, or a black hole in the universe.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　23.

  "description": "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　Gorillas have a word for it</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Koko is the first gorilla to have been taught sign language (a way of communicating by using hands and fingers rather than speech). With a vocabulary of more than1000 words, she is the first to prove we share a world with other intelligent beings who feel emotions, look forward to celebrations and also have a sense of humor.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　The 30-year study of Koko has redefined science's concept of gorilla intelligence. 46. But what had not been recognized by the scientific community was that gorillas have the ability to learn a language and have complex emotions.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Koko lives in the Santa Cruz mountains in North America, in a wooded spot overlooking a valley. 47. She has her own home, with curtains, and a nest of blankets, which is her bed, in one corner. She has a barrel on which she likes to sit when 'talking' to humans - gorillas feel more secure when they can look down on others - while her toys are spread everywhere. In addition she has an outside enclosure where she spends her days when it is not raining.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　It is her conversations with her teacher, Dr Penny Patterson, that are inspiring. Penny explains: &lsquo;The reality of my discovery is that our abilities as humans, our skills, sensibilities and emotions are very similar to the great apes. 48. .</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　When she began teaching Koko sign language, placing the little fingers of the one-year-old gorilla into the correct positions for 'drink', 'eat', 'more', and rewarding her with food, Dr Patterson had no idea how quickly Koko would learn. &ldquo;At first, it seemed Koko was using sign language as a tool to get something,&rdquo; says Patterson. 'It became the kind of reward system that you could expect of a cat or a dog. But early in her training, she began to combine signs that made me think she was capable of more.&rsquo; 49. For example, she didn't know the word for 'ring', so she combined the signs for &lsquo;finger&rsquo; and 'bracelet' to express it.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Dr Patterson continues: &lsquo;Koko loves babies and young people. And when she is asked what gorillas like best, she always says &quot;Gorilla love eat, good&rsquo;&rsquo;.' One of Patterson's favorite stories demonstrates Koko's sense of humor. 50. .</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　From the age of three, Koko shared her accommodation with Michael who was intended as a mate. However, Michael died suddenly two years ago of a heart attack. &lsquo;Koko went into a depression following Michael's death,&rsquo; says Patterson. &ldquo;She would sit for hours with her head hung low looking upset.&rdquo;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　Dr Patterson asked her if she was looking forward to moving to Hawaii, where Patterson is raising money to build a gorilla refuge. Koko signed &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, provided she could have curtains in her new home!</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　A. When a visitor asked her to show him something scary, she held up a mirror to his face!</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　B. What we have learnt is that gorillas are more complex than we ever imaged.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　C. According to some scientists, genetically there is only a 2% difference between gorillas and humans: we share the same blood type, have the same number of hairs per square inch and also the same temperament.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　D. Koko signed that she wanted a cat.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　E. Now Koko is so proficient in sign language that if she doesn't know a word she invents one.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　F. She has her own home, with curtains, and a nest of blankets, which is her bed, in one corner.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t第6部分：完形填空(第51-555题，每题1分，共15分)</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　下面的短文有15处空白，请根据短文内容为每处空白确定1个最佳选项。</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　The Beginning of American Literature</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　America has always been a land of beginnings.

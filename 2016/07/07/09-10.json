Upon hearing the unexpected news, he was so surprised that he couldn&rsquo;t utter a word.</p>\n<p>\n\tSection VII English-Chinese Translation</p>\n<p>\n\tTranslate the following passage into Chinese. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)</p>\n<p>\n\tSeated behind the front desk at a New York firm, the receptionist was efficient.</p>\n<p>\n\tStylishly dressed, the firm&rsquo;s newest employee had a pleasant telephone voice and a natural charm that put clients at ease. The company was pleased: (1) Clearly, this was a person who took considerable pride in personal appearance. David King, the receptionist, is unusual, but by no means unique. (2) Just as all truck drivers and construction workers are no longer necessarily men, all secretaries and receptionists are no longer automatically women. The number of men in women-dominated fields is still small and they haven&rsquo;t attracted the attention that has often followed women advancing into male-dominated fields, but men are moving into more and more jobs that have traditionally been held by women.</p>\n<p>\n\tStrictly speaking, the phenomenon is not new. For the past several decades, men have been quietly entering fields such as nursing, social work and elementary education. But today no job seems off-limits. Men serve coffee in offices and meals on airplanes. (3) These changes are helping to influence some of the long-standing traditions about the types of work men and women can do -- but they also produce some undeniable problems for the men who are entering those</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat kinds of men venture into these so-called &ldquo;women&rsquo;s fields&rdquo;? All kinds. (4) &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any definite answers I&rsquo;d be comfortable with,&rdquo;explains Joseph Pleck, Ph.D., of the Wellesley College Centre for Research on Women.</p>\n<p>\n\tSam Ormont, for example, a thirty-year-old nurse at a Boston hospital, went into nursing because the army had trained him as a medical worker. (5) &ldquo;I found that work very interesting.&rdquo;he recalled, &ldquo;and when I got out of the service it just seemed natural for me to go into something medical. I wasn&rsquo;t really interested in becoming a doctor.&rdquo;Thirty-five-year-old David King, an out-of-work actor, found a job as a receptionist because he was having trouble landing roles in Broadway plays and he needed to pay the rent.</p>\n<p>\n\t(6) In other words, men enter &ldquo;female&rdquo;jobs out of the same consideration for personal interest and economic necessity that motivates anyone looking for work. But similarities often end there. Men in female-dominated jobs are conspicuous. As a group, their work histories differ in most respects from those of their female colleagues, and they are frequently treated differently by the people with whom they are in professional contact.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question naturally arises: Why are there still approximately ninety-nine female secretaries for every one male? There is also a more serious issue. Most men don&rsquo;t want to be receptionists, nurses, secretaries or sewing workers. Put simply, these are not generally considered very masculine jobs. (7) To choose such a line of work is to invite ridicule.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;There was kidding in the beginning,&rdquo;recalls Ormont. &ldquo;Kids coming from school ask what I am, and when I say &lsquo;A nurse,&rsquo;they laugh at me. I just smile and say, &lsquo;You know, there are female doctors, too.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, there are encouraging signs. Years ago, male grade school teachers were as rare as male nurses. Today more than one elementary school teacher in six is male.</p>\n<p>\n\t(8) Can we anticipate a day when secretaries will be an even mix of men and women -- or when the mention of a male nurse will no longer raise eyebrows? It&rsquo;s probably coming -- but not very soon.</p>\n<p>\n\t翻译</p>\n<p>\n\tVII: English-Chinese Translation (20 points)</p>\n<p>\n\t1. 他显然，他是个对自己的仪表感到相当自豪的人。</p>\n<p>\n\t2. 正像卡车司机和建筑工人再没必要都是男的一样，秘书和接待员再也不一定都是女的。</p>\n<p>\n\t3. 这些变化正影响着长期存在的传统观念中关于男女各可以干哪几类工作的看法，但这对于进入原先以妇女为主的那些的男人来说，无疑也带来一些问题。</p>\n<p>\n\t4. 我还没听说过有任何使我感到满意的确切答案。</p>\n<p>\n\t5. 他回忆说：&ldquo;我觉得那种工作十分有趣，当我退役时，对我来说，去干某种医务工作，似乎是极其自然的。&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t6. 换句话说，男人干起了&ldquo;女人干的&rdquo;工作，其动机是同任何找工作干的人一样，既出于个人的兴趣，也出于经济上需要的考虑。</p>\n<p>\n\t7. 选定这一类工作是会惹人笑话的。</p>\n<p>\n\t8. 我们是否能预见到这么一天：那时当秘书的男女各占一半或有人提到某个男人当护士时，人们不会再感到吃惊?</p>\n<p>\n\t翻译，汉语、英语的能力都要达到要求。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p794317/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p794317\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p793732/\">洪灾主人泪别6000头猪 暴雨相关表达你都会吗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p792471/\">Quora精选：大天朝的网络语言</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p793698/\">鲍里斯退出法拉奇辞职 脱欧功臣说不干就不干</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p793570/\">娱乐周刊选出上半年10部最佳美剧 你都追了吗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p793316/\">活出精彩人生 必须学会这11个快乐秘诀</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p745566/\">陈晓陈妍希领证！那些因戏生情的欧美明星</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p793573/\">《忍者神龟2》：没有特效的原片是有多搞笑</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p790923/\">开卷考依然一脸懵逼，窍门在这里！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p793722/\">你为何单身&如何摆脱单身 最科学的解释在这</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p790562/\">沪江“每日一说”功能开通！口语就该这么练！</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

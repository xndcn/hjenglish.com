You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bankfollowing the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Eachchoice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tQuestions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tPhysical activity does the body good, and there's growing evidence that it helps the brain too.Researchers in the Netherlands report that children who get more exercise, whether at school or on their own, __26__ to have higher GPAs and better scores on standardized tests. In a __27__of 14 studies that looked at physical activity and academic __28__ , investigators found that the more children moved, the better their grades were in school, __29__ in the basic subjects of math, English and reading.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tThe data will certainly fuel the ongoing debate over whether physical education classes should be cut as schools struggle to __30__ on smaller budgets. The arguments against physical education have included concerns that gym time may be taking away from study time. With standardized test scores in the U.S. __31__ in recent years, some administrators believe students need to spend more time in the classroom instead of on the playground. But as these findings show, exercise and academics may not be __32__ exclusive. Physical activity can improve blood __33__ to the brain, fueling memory, attention and creativity, which are__34__ to learning. And exercise releases hormones that can improve __35__ and relieve stress, which can also help learning. So while it may seem as if kids are just exercising their bodies when they're running around, they may actually be exercising their brains as well.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA.attendance B.consequently C.current D.depressing E.dropping F.essential G.feasible H.flow I.mood J.mutually K.particularly L.performance M.review N.survive O.tend</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tSection B</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tDirections: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tFinding the Right Home&mdash;and Contentment,Too</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[A] When your elderly relative needs to enter some sort of long-term care facility&mdash;a moment few parents or children approach without fear&mdash;what you would like is to have everything made clear.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[B] Does assisted living really mark a great improvement over a nursing home, or has the industry simply hired better interior designers? Are nursing homes as bad as people fear, or is that an out-moded stereotype (固定看法)? Can doing one's homework really steer families to the best places? It is genuinely hard to know.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[C] I am about to make things more complicated by suggesting that what kind of facility an older person lives in may matter less than we have assumed. And that the characteristics adult children look for when they begin the search are not necessarily the things that make a difference to the people who are going to move in. I am not talking about the quality of care,let me hastily add. Nobody flourishes in a gloomy environment with irresponsible staff and a poor safety record. But an accumulating body of research indicates that some distinctions between one type of elder care and another have little real bearing on how well residents do.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[D] The most recent of these studies, published in The Journal of Applied Gerontology, surveyed150 Connecticut residents of assisted living, nursing homes and smaller residential care homes(known in some states as board and care homes or adult care homes). Researchers from the University of Connecticut Health Center asked the residents a large number of questions about their quality of life, emotional well-being and social interaction, as well as about the quality of the facilities.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[E] &quot;We thought we would see differences based on the housing types,&quot; said the lead author of the study, Julie Robison, an associate professor of medicine at the university. A reasonable assumption&mdash; don't families struggle to avoid nursing homes and suffer real guilt if they can't?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[F] In the initial results, assisted living residents did paint the most positive picture. They were less likely to report symptoms of depression than those in the other facilities, for instance, and less likely to be bored or lonely. They scored higher on social interaction.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[G] But when the researchers plugged in a number of other variables, such differences disappeared. It is not the housing type, they found, that creates differences in residents' responses. &quot;It is the characteristics of the specific environment they are in, combined with their own personal characteristics&mdash;how healthy they feel they are, their age and marital status,&quot; Dr. Robison explained. Whether residents felt involved in the decision to move and how long they had lived there also proved significant.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[H] An elderly person who describes herself as in poor health, therefore, might be no less depressed in assisted living (even if her children preferred it) than in a nursing home. A person who had input into where he would move and has had time to adapt to it might do as well in a nursing home as in a small residential care home, other factors being equal. It is an interaction between the person and the place, not the sort of place in itself, that leads to better or worse experiences. &quot;You can't just say, 'Let's put this person in a residential care home instead of a nursing home&mdash;she will be much better off,'&quot; Dr. Robison said. What matters, sheadded, &quot;is a combination of what people bring in with them, and what they find there.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[I] Such findings, which run counter to common sense, have surfaced before. In a multi-state study of assisted living, for instance, University of North Carolina researchers found that a host of variables&mdash;the facility's type, size or age; whether a chain owned it; how attractive the neighborhood was&mdash;had no significant relationship to how the residents fared in terms of illness,mental decline, hospitalizations or mortality. What mattered most was the residents, physical health and mental status. What people were like when they came in had greater consequence than what happened once they were there.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[J] As I was considering all this, a press release from a respected research firm crossed my desk, announcing that the five-star rating system that Medicare developed in 2008 to help families compare nursing home quality also has little relationship to how satisfied its residents or their family members are. As a matter of fact, consumers expressed higher satisfaction with the one-star facilities, the lowest rated, than with the five-star ones. (More on this study and the star ratings will appear in a subsequent post.)</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[K] Before we collectively tear our hair out&mdash;how are we supposed to find our way in a landscape this confusing?&mdash;here is a thought from Dr. Philip Sloane, a geriatrician (老年病学专家) at the University of North Carolina：&quot;In a way, that could be liberating for families.&quot;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[L] Of course, sons and daughters want to visit the facilities, talk to the administrators and residents and other families, and do everything possible to fulfill their duties. But perhaps they don't have to turn themselves into private investigators or Congressional subcommittees. &quot;Families can look a bit more for where the residents are going to be happy,&quot; Dr. Sloane said.And involving the future resident in the process can be very important.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[M] We all have our own ideas about what would bring our parents happiness. They have their ideas, too. A friend recently took her mother to visit an expensive assisted living/nursing home near my town. I have seen this place&mdash;it is elegant, inside and out. But nobody greeted the daughter and mother when they arrived, though the visit had been planned; nobody introduced them to the other residents. When they had lunch in the dining room, they sat alone at a table.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t[N] The daughter feared her mother would be ignored there, and so she decided to move her into a more welcoming facility. Based on what is emerging from some of this research, that might have been as rational a way as any to reach a decision.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t36. Many people feel guilty when they cannot find a place other than a nursing home for their parents.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t37. Though it helps for children to investigate care facilities, involving their parents in the decision-making process may prove very important.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t38. It is really difficult to tell if assisted living is better than a nursing home.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t39. How a resident feels depends on an interaction between themselves and the care facility they live in.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t40. The author thinks her friend made a rational decision in choosing a more hospitable place over an apparently elegant assisted living home.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t41. The system Medicare developed to rate nursing home quality is of little help to finding a satisfactory place.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t42. At first the researchers of the most recent study found residents in assisted living facilities gave higher scores on social interaction.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t43. What kind of care facility old people live in may be less important than we think.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t44. The findings of the latest research were similar to an earlier multi-state study of assisted living.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t45. A resident's satisfaction with a care facility has much to do with whether they had participated in the decision to move in and how long they had stayed there.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tSection C</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tDirections: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time，you should listen carefully for its general idea.When the passage is read for the second time，you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard.Finally，when the passage is read for the third time，you should check what you have written.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tPassage One</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tQuestions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tRussell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tFor example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. &quot;You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,&quot; said Russell.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tSome robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robot shave been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tIt will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tRobots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tThe biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to do sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo (禁忌).</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tOne simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tIf the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps (嘟嘟声), and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tThe most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe is moral,and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t46. What does the author say about the threat of robots?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) It may constitute a challenge to computer programmers.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) It accompanies all machinery involving high technology.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t47. What would we think of a person who invades our personal space according to the author?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) They are aggressive.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) They are outgoing.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) They are ignorant.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) They are ill-bred.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t48. How do robots learn human values?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) By interacting with humans in everyday life situations.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) By following the daily routines of civilized human beings.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) By picking up patterns from massive data on human behavior.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) By imitating the behavior of properly brought-up human beings.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t49. What will a well-programmed robot do when facing an unusual situation?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) Keep a distance from possible dangers.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) Stop to seek advice from a human being.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) Trigger its built-in alarm system at once.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) Do sufficient testing before taking action,</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t50. What is most difficult to do when we turn human values into a programmable code?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) Determine what is moral and ethical.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) Design some large-scale experiments.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) Set rules for man-machine interaction.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) Develop a more sophisticated program.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tPassage Two</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tQuestions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tWhy do some people live to be older than others? You know the standard explanations: keeping a moderate diet, engaging in regular exercise, etc. But what effect does your personality have on your longevity (长寿)? Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives? A new study in the Journal of American Geriatrics Society looked at this question by examining the personality characteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tThe study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing, more active and less neurotic(神经质的)than other people. Long-living women are also more likely to be sympathetic and cooperative than women with a normal life span. These findings are in agreement with what you would expect from the evolutionary theory: those who like to make friends and help others can gather enough resources to make it through tough times.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tInterestingly, however, other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had no impact on whether study participants were likely to live longer. Those who were more self-disciplined, for instance, were no more likely to live to be very old. Also, being open to new ideas had no relationship to long life, which might explain all those bad-tempered old people who are fixed in their ways.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tWhether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of along standing psychological debate. But the new paper suggests that if you want long life,you should strive to be as outgoing as possible.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tUnfortunately, another recent study shows that your mother's personality may also help determine your longevity. That study looked at nearly 28,000 Norwegian mothers and found that those moms who were more anxious, depressed and angry were more likely to feed their kids unhealthy diets. Patterns of childhood eating can be hard to break when we're adults,which may mean that kids of depressed moms end up dying younger.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tPersonality isn't destiny (命运), and everyone knows that individuals can learn to change. But both studies show that long life isn't just a matter of your physical health but of your mental health.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t51. The aim of the study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society is ____.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) to see whether people's personality affects their life span</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) to find out if one's lifestyle has any effect on their health</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) to investigate the role of exercise in living a long life</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) to examine all the factors contributing to longevity</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t52. What does the author imply about outgoing and sympathetic people?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) They have a good understanding of evolution.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) They are better at negotiating an agreement.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) They generally appear more resourceful.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) They are more likely to get over hardship.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t53. What finding of the study might prove somewhat out of our expectation?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) Easy-going people can also live a relatively long life.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) Personality characteristics that prove advantageous actually vary with times.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) Such personality characteristics as self-discipline have no effect on longevity.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) Readiness to accept new ideas helps one enjoy longevity.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t54. What does the recent study of Norwegian mothers show?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) Children's personality characteristics are invariably determined by their mothers.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) People with unhealthy eating habits are likely to die sooner.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) Mothers' influence on children may last longer than fathers'.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) Mothers' ，negative personality characteristics may affect their children's life spans.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t55. What can we learn from the findings of the two new studies?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tA) Anxiety and depression more often than not cut short one's life span.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tB) Longevity results from a combination of mental and physical health.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tC) Personality plays a decisive role in how healthy one is.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tD) Health is in large part related to one's lifestyle.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tPart Ⅳ Translation (30 minutes)</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tDirections: For this part, you are allowed 30minutes to translate a passage from Chinese into English. You should write your answer on Answer Sheet 2.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t功夫（Kung Fu）是中国武术（martial arts）的俗称。中国武术的起源可以追溯到自卫的需要、狩猎活动以及古代中国的军事训练。它是中国传统体育运动的一种，年轻人和老年人都练。它已逐渐演变成了中国文化的特殊元素。作为中国的国宝，功夫有上百种不同的风格，是世界上练得最多的武术形式。有些风格模仿了动物的动作，还有一些则受到了中国哲学思想、神话和传说的启发。</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t参考答案</div>\n<div>\n\t<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t\tPart III Reading Comprehension</div>\n\t<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t\t26-35：OMLKN EJHFI</div>\n\t<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t\t36-45：ELBHN JFCIG</div>\n\t<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t\t46-55：CDCBA ADCDB</div>\n\t<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t\tPart IV Translation</div>\n\t<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Chinese Martial Arts, commonly known as Kung Fu, can trace its origin back to the needs of self-defence, hunting and ancient Chinese military training.

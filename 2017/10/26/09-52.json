She bursts into a third-grade classroom and greets her students： &ldquo;Salvete， omnes!&rdquo; (Hello， everyone!) The kids respond in kind， and soon they are studying derivatives. &ldquo;How many people are in a duet?&rdquo; High asks. All the kids know the answer， and when she asks how they know， a boy responds， &ldquo;Because duo is 'two' in Latin.&rdquo; High replies， &ldquo;Plaudite!&rdquo; and the 14 kids erupt in applause. They learn the Latin root later， or side， and construct such English words as bilateral and quadrilateral. &ldquo;Latin's going to open up so many doors for you，&rdquo; High says. &ldquo;You're going to be able to figure out the meaning of words you've never seen before.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHigh teaches at Providence Elementary School in Fairfax City， Va.， which has a lot riding on the success of her efforts. As part of Virginia's high-stakes testing program， schools that don't boost their scores by the year 2007 could lose state funding. So Fairfax City， just 18 miles southwest of the White House， has upgraded its two crumbling elementary schools with new high-tech television studios， computer labs and one very old feature&mdash;&mdash;mandatory Latin.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere lies one of the more counterintuitive developments of the standardized-testing movement： Though some critics complain that teachers are forced to dumb down their lessons and &ldquo;teach to the test，&rdquo; some schools are offering more challenging course work as a way of engaging students. In the past three years， scores of elementary schools in high-stakes testing states such as Texas， Virginia and Massachusetts have added Latin programs. Says Allen Griffith， a member of the Fairfax City school board： &ldquo;If we're trying to improve English skills， teaching Latin is an awfully effective， proved method.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not your father's Latin， which was taught to elite college-bound high schoolers and drilled into them through memorization. Its tedium and perceived irrelevance almost drove Latin from public schools. Today's growth in elementary school Latin has been spurred by new， interactive oral curriculums， enlivened by lessons in Roman mythology and culture. &ldquo;One thing that makes it engaging for kids is the goofy fun of investigating these guys in togas，&rdquo; says Marion Polsky， author of First Latin： A Language Discovery Program， the textbook used in Fairfax City.</p>\n<p>\n\tLatin enthusiasts believe that if young students learn word roots， they will be able to decipher unfamiliar words. (By some estimates， 65% of all English words have Latin roots.) Latin is an almost purely phonetic language. There are no silent letters， and each letter represents a single sound. That makes it useful in teaching reading. And once kids master the grammatical structure of Latin&mdash;&mdash;which is simple， logical and consistent&mdash;&mdash;they will more easily grasp the many grammatical exceptions in English.</p>\n<p>\n\t注(1)：本文选自Time;12/11/2000， p61;<br />\n\t注(2)：本文习题命题模仿对象2002年真题text 4;</p>\n<p>\n\t1.

Furthermore, the advertising expenditure for instant coffee was far greater than that for regular coffee.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tEfforts were made to find the cause of the consumers' seemingly unreasonable resistance to the product. The reason given by most people was dislike for the taste. The producers suspected that there might be deeper reasons, however. This was confirmed by one of motivation research's classic studies, one often cited in the trade. Mason Haire, of the University of California, constructed two shopping lists that were identical except for one item. There were six items common to both lists: hamburger, carrots(胡萝卜), baking powder, bread, canned peaches and potatoes, with the brands or amounts specified. The seventh item, in the fifth place on both lists, read &ldquo;11b. Maxwell House coffee&rdquo; on one list and &ldquo;Nescafe instant coffee&rdquo; on the other. One list was given to each person in a group of fifty women, and the other list to those in another group of the same size. The women were asked to study their lists and then to describe, as far as they could, the kind of woman (&ldquo;personality and character&rdquo;) who would draw up that shopping list. Nearly half of those who had received the list including instant coffee described a housewife who was lazy and a poor planner. On the other hand, only one woman in the other group described the housewife, who had included regular coffee on her list, as lazy; only six of that group suggested that she was a poor planner. Eight women felt that the instant coffee user was probably not a good wife! No one in the other group drew such a conclusion about the housewife who intended to buy regular coffee.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t36.The fact that producers found resistance to their product despite the fact that they spent more advertising money on instant than regular coffee shows that ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) advertising does not assure favorable sales result</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) companies spent more money on advertising than they should</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) people pay little attention to advertising</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) the more one advertises the better the sales picture</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t37.In this instance, the purpose of motivation research was to discover ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) why people drink coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) why instant coffee did not taste good</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) why regular coffee was successful</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) the real reason why people would not buy instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t38.This investigation indicated that ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) 50 percent of housewives are lazy</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) housewives who use instant coffee are lazy</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) many women believe that wives who use instant coffee are lazy</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) wives who use regular coffee are good planners</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t39.On the results of this test, the producers probably revised their advertising to show a ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) lazy housewife using regular coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) hard-working housewife using instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) lazy housewife using instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) man obviously enjoying the taste of instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t40.Implied but not stated:____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) Despite its advantages, most people disliked instant coffee because of its taste.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) The advertising expenditure for instant coffee was greater than that for　regular coffee.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) Very often we do not know the real reasons for doing things.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) Taste is the principal factor in determining what we buy.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tPart ⅢVocabulary (20 minutes)</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tDirections:There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Every graduate faces this question when starting his career. A large number of college graduates prefer to stay in big cities, which mean more experiences, more opportunities to see the big world and more space for career development. At the same time, higher salary is another temptation。</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tBut some other graduates intend to start in small towns. Even though there may not be many big companies, they can have a quieter and less competitive life. Another reason is that they can be a big fish in a small pond. They can easily get the management&rsquo;s attention and may win promotion earlier。</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs far as I am concerned, I prefer to start in a metropolis like Shanghai. A good begin is half the battle, and in Shanghai I can find a job in a big company where I can meet people from different places and cultures. I will learn from them what I can not get from textbooks.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>参考例文二：</strong></p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tNowadays, more and more university graduates complain that graduation does not equate to employment. They experience great difficulties finding satisfactory jobs. What is the cause of this phenomenon</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn my opinion, there are four causes:</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tFirst, graduates lack experience. They spend most of their time at school studying academic subjects and lack relevant job training. Only after graduation do they realize it&rsquo;s hard to find jobs.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tSecond, competition among graduates grows more bitter and more bitter and bitter. The supply of university graduates exceeds social demand. This results in a decreased chance for any individual graduate to find a job.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThird, some students don&rsquo;t study hard. Some of them skip classes just because they have no interest in certain subjects. Some play computer games or pursue other interests. Some sleep in class or in the library. Then they leave the sheltered environment of the university campus, to discover they don&rsquo;t have adequate knowledge to apply for many positions, which makes them feel lost and frustrated.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tFinally, some graduates are conceited. They lack experience but ask for a high salary, which is impractical.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tSo, university students should try their best to change this situation. When they are in school, they should make the most of their time and put their heart into their studies. They can hold part-time jobs in their spare time to accumulate relevant work experience. They should take part in some social activities and provide themselves with special training, if possible. When they graduate and apply for jobs, they should attach more importance to accumulating experience than to their starting salary.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tOn University Students&rsquo; Pressure in Finding Jobs</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAbout a decade ago, university students could find satisfactory and enviable jobs after their graduation. But now, things are different. Today's university students usually have much pressure in finding fairly good jobs. They always say disappointedly that graduation means joblessness. Why nowadays university students have so much pressure in finding jobs?</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn my opinion, this kind of pressure is mainly caused by three reasons. Firstly, the government is enrolling more and more university students year by year. And the growth of the students' number has surpassed that of the need of the society. So, when so many students graduate at a time, the chance of finding jobs becomes tiny. Secondly, today's university students, most of them are the &quot;only-child&quot;, who are more mentally frail. Since they are indulged greatly at home and haven't been trained to do things on their own, once it is their turn to go out of the campus and find jobs by themselves and decide what kind of jobs to choose, they feel bewildered and don't know what to do. If their first try fails, they will be frustrated and think that it is really hard to find jobs. Thirdly, some university students are not qualified for good and challenging jobs. After entering the university, they don't study as hard as they did in high schools. They begin to sleep during the class or even be absent for classes. Some are addicted to computer games or Jin Yong's novels, or step into the two-person-world too early. Because these things have taken up so much of their time and energy, their study is neglected. After four years of university life, they haven't gained the knowledge those fairly good jobs or certain positions require.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>词汇：</strong></p>\n\t<p>\n\t\topportunities [ˌɒpəˈtjuːnɪtɪ] n. 机会，良机</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">development&nbsp;[dɪˈvɛləpmənt]&nbsp;</span>n.&nbsp;发展，扩展</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">competitive&nbsp;[kəmˈpɛtɪtɪv]</span>&nbsp;adj.&nbsp;竞争的；有竞争力的；好竞争的</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tdisappointedly [disə'pɔitidli] adv. 失望地</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t怎么样？有用的表达和句型你记住了吗？祝大家都取得好成绩。想第一时间考后对答案，请继续关注沪江英语。</p>\n</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167954/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167954\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1172423/\">2017年6月四六级作文预测——共享单车（上）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1171998/\">吃米饭会发胖？那怎样防止呢？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1172428/\">茅台酒业很苦恼：中国年轻人就是不上钩……</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1172514/\">最新流行的饮食方式，让你2倍速减肥！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1168444/\">冲刺四级高分：四级高分作文写作技巧（一）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p966015/\">2017年6月英语六级作文预测(十一)：勤俭节约</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1172442/\">2017年6月四六级作文预测——共享单车（下）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1092331/\">Quora精选：如何为求职面试做准备？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1170638/\">国外那些奇葩说明书，简直让人怀疑人生！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1172482/\">亚马逊的人工智能好厉害，能追星了</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

  "description": "<p style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">\n\t2017年第一次英语六级考试开考时间：6月17日。</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">\n\t为了满足大家练习的需求，特奉上英语六级冲刺模拟题。建议大家当成正式考试来对待。预祝大家都取得好成绩。一起来做做看吧。</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tThe producers of instant coffee found their product strongly resisted in the market places despite their manifest (明显的) advantages. Furthermore, the advertising expenditure for instant coffee was far greater than that for regular coffee.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tEfforts were made to find the cause of the consumers' seemingly unreasonable resistance to the product. The reason given by most people was dislike for the taste. The producers suspected that there might be deeper reasons, however. This was confirmed by one of motivation research's classic studies, one often cited in the trade. Mason Haire, of the University of California, constructed two shopping lists that were identical except for one item. There were six items common to both lists: hamburger, carrots(胡萝卜), baking powder, bread, canned peaches and potatoes, with the brands or amounts specified. The seventh item, in the fifth place on both lists, read &ldquo;11b. Maxwell House coffee&rdquo; on one list and &ldquo;Nescafe instant coffee&rdquo; on the other. One list was given to each person in a group of fifty women, and the other list to those in another group of the same size. The women were asked to study their lists and then to describe, as far as they could, the kind of woman (&ldquo;personality and character&rdquo;) who would draw up that shopping list. Nearly half of those who had received the list including instant coffee described a housewife who was lazy and a poor planner. On the other hand, only one woman in the other group described the housewife, who had included regular coffee on her list, as lazy; only six of that group suggested that she was a poor planner. Eight women felt that the instant coffee user was probably not a good wife! No one in the other group drew such a conclusion about the housewife who intended to buy regular coffee.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t36.The fact that producers found resistance to their product despite the fact that they spent more advertising money on instant than regular coffee shows that ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) advertising does not assure favorable sales result</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) companies spent more money on advertising than they should</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) people pay little attention to advertising</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) the more one advertises the better the sales picture</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t37.In this instance, the purpose of motivation research was to discover ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) why people drink coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) why instant coffee did not taste good</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) why regular coffee was successful</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) the real reason why people would not buy instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t38.This investigation indicated that ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) 50 percent of housewives are lazy</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) housewives who use instant coffee are lazy</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) many women believe that wives who use instant coffee are lazy</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) wives who use regular coffee are good planners</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t39.On the results of this test, the producers probably revised their advertising to show a ____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) lazy housewife using regular coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) hard-working housewife using instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) lazy housewife using instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) man obviously enjoying the taste of instant coffee</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t40.Implied but not stated:____.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) Despite its advantages, most people disliked instant coffee because of its taste.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tB) The advertising expenditure for instant coffee was greater than that for　regular coffee.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) Very often we do not know the real reasons for doing things.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tD) Taste is the principal factor in determining what we buy.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tPart ⅢVocabulary (20 minutes)</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tDirections:There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part. For each sentence there are four choices marked A), B),C)and D). Choose the ONE that best completes the sentence. Then mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t41.After leaving school, Nigel decided to ____ in the army.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) enroll B) sign</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) register D) enlist</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t42.Even at that early stage the school felt that she ____ a good chance of passing her exams.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) stood B) achieved</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) possessed D) took</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t43.Although the coach had not thought her a good tennis player at first, she ____ to be a champion.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) came round B) turned out</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) turned up D) came out</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t44.If she hadn't ____ on the last question, her score on the test would have been perfect.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) slipped up B) slept up</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) spilt up D) slipped on</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t45.The ____ of new scientific discoveries to industrial production methods usually makes jobs easier to do.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) addition B) association</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) application D) affection</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t46.The government ____ the people to be economical of oil consumption.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) call in B) call up</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) call on D) call off</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t47.It's possible to ____ from all the information give</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tn to us and to make various decisions.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) enclose B) generalize</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) tackle D) withdraw</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t48.She gets along very well with everyone; so she is the most ____ member of our family.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) rusty B) impetuous</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) compatible D) imperious</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t49.Immigrants, fleeing from political and religious persecution, came from　nonindustrialized ____ industrialized countries.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tA) also B) and too</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\tC) as well as D) and both</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\t50.Mary is by no means learned; nor is she good at any practical trade.

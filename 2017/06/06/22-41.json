For example, taking care of a pet can teach people responsibility, which is new to many university students. In addition, pets can keep people company and are well-known for making people happy.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile there are many reasons for having a pet, keeping one illegally in the dorms can be problematic. First of all, some students may be allergic to pets. Secondly, some dorm mates may not care for the way the pet smells. Thirdly, many pets are loud and may disturb the other residents in your dorm or hall.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor many universities, students keeping pets in the dormitories is against the rules. Despite this, some students choose to have a pet at university.

Among them, college graduates are a fast-growing force that can&rsquo;t be ignored. The craze for being a civil servant is not limited to liberal arts majors, as it&rsquo;s also gaining popularity among science and engineering students.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the final analysis, this growing trend among the youngsters is mainly attributable to two factors &ndash; ambitions and comforts. On one hand, many ambitious college graduates view these exams as a springboard to a higher social status, greater power and prestige, on which many of their other wishes rest. On the other, as being a civil servant generally means a as well stable income, enviable health care and pension programs, as other comforts of life, it&rsquo;s quite an appealing career option to many people, especially in this age of sluggish world economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tPersonally, the desire to be a government official is beyond reproach, as the nation and the people do need an injection of new blood into the civil service sectors. The fresh-faced college graduates, armed with lofty ideals, new vision, and strong drive, are undoubtedly among the best candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>参考范文二</strong><br />\n\tIn&nbsp;recent&nbsp;years,&nbsp;there&nbsp;are&nbsp;more&nbsp;and&nbsp;more&nbsp;people&nbsp;who&nbsp;have&nbsp;participated&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;test&nbsp;for&nbsp;national&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servants.&nbsp;Millions&nbsp;of&nbsp;students&nbsp;choose&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servant&nbsp;as&nbsp;their&nbsp;most&nbsp;ideal&nbsp;occupation&nbsp;after&nbsp;graduation.&nbsp;And&nbsp;among&nbsp;them,&nbsp;the&nbsp;high-educated,&nbsp;like&nbsp;masters&nbsp;and&nbsp;doctors,&nbsp;take&nbsp;quite&nbsp;a&nbsp;large&nbsp;percentage.&nbsp;The&nbsp;craze&nbsp;in&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servant&nbsp;test&nbsp;has&nbsp;attracted&nbsp;widespread&nbsp;attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe&nbsp;following&nbsp;reasons&nbsp;can&nbsp;account&nbsp;for&nbsp;this&nbsp;kind&nbsp;of&nbsp;craze.&nbsp;Above&nbsp;all,&nbsp;nowadays&nbsp;college&nbsp;students&nbsp;face&nbsp;great&nbsp;employment&nbsp;pressure.&nbsp;Civil&nbsp;servant,&nbsp;as&nbsp;one&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most&nbsp;stable&nbsp;professions&nbsp;in&nbsp;today&rsquo;s&nbsp;China,&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;their&nbsp;preferable&nbsp;choice.&nbsp;Moreover,&nbsp;in&nbsp;recent&nbsp;years,&nbsp;the&nbsp;welfare&nbsp;and&nbsp;salary&nbsp;of&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servants&nbsp;have&nbsp;been&nbsp;improved&nbsp;greatly,&nbsp;which&nbsp;undoubtedly&nbsp;attracts&nbsp;many&nbsp;people.&nbsp;Besides,&nbsp;the&nbsp;high&nbsp;social&nbsp;position&nbsp;of&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servants&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important&nbsp;factor&nbsp;drawing&nbsp;many&nbsp;people&nbsp;to&nbsp;take&nbsp;part&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servant&nbsp;test.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion,&nbsp;this&nbsp;craze&nbsp;in&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servant&nbsp;test&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;following&nbsp;years.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;long&nbsp;run,&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;do&nbsp;good&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;development&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation.&nbsp;If&nbsp;most&nbsp;high&nbsp;quality&nbsp;talents&nbsp;gather&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;government&nbsp;departments,&nbsp;it&nbsp;might&nbsp;lead&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;waste&nbsp;of&nbsp;resources.&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;both&nbsp;the&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;government&nbsp;should&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;more&nbsp;objective&nbsp;recognition&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;civil&nbsp;servant&nbsp;test&nbsp;craze.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">备考推荐：<a href=\"http://class.hujiang.com/17355373/intro?ch_source=ipo_en_0_rw&amp;editorid=842bc6fd\" target=\"_blank\">六级强化冲刺班</a></strong></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167036/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167036\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1126451/\">有声双语美文：人生这本书要一页一页读</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1159120/\">看完《花儿与少年》，我迷上了一个人练口语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167933/\">给工资都不要？世界上还有这样的国家？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p749165/\">英语四级作文：10个你想不到的总结句式</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1160201/\">Quora精选：怎样练成一口流利的英语？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1168339/\">《神奇女侠》创了世界纪录，女性导演的春天</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1161114/\">用手机学习的50种场合</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167042/\">欧盟要建免费Wi-fi，这还有没有王法了？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1154715/\">夏天到了，游泳必备的口语表达赶紧学起来！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167429/\">100年前的生活妙招：3种超有用的绳结</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Images of female bodies are everywhere. Women&mdash;and their bodyparts--sell everything from food to cars.Popular film and television actressesare becoming younger, taller and thinner. Some have even been known tofaint onthe set from lack of food. Women's magazines are full &amp;articles urging thatif they can just lose thoselast twentypounds, they'll have it all&mdash;the perfect marriage, loving children, great sex,and a rewarding career</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B. Why arc standards of beauty being imposed on women, the majorityofwhom are naturally larger and moremature than any of the models? The roots,some analysts say, are economic. By presenting an ideal difficult toachieve andmaintain, the cosmetic and diet product industries arc assured of growth andprofits. And it's noaccident that youth is increasingly promoted, along withthinness, as an essential criterion of beauty. If not allwomen need to loseweight, for sure they're all aging, says the Quebec Action Network for Women'sHealth inits 2001 report. And, according to the industry, age is a disasterthat needs to be dealt with.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C. The stakes are huge. On the one hand, women who are insecure about their bodies arc more likely tobuybeauty products, new clothes, and diet aids. It is estimated that the dietindustry alone is worth anywherebetween 40 to 100 billion (U.S.. a year selling temporary weight loss (90% to 95% of dieters regainthe lostweight.. On the other hand, research indicatesthat exposure to images of thin, young, air-brushed femalebodies is linked todepression, loss of self-esteem and the development of unhealthy eating habitsin womenand girls.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D. The American research group Anorexia Nervosa & Related EatingDisorders, Inc. says that one out of everyfour college-aged women usesunhealthy methods of weight control--including fasting, skippingmeals,excessive exercise, laxative (泻药. abuse, andself-induced vomiting. The pressure to be thin is also affectingyoung girls:the Canadian Women's Health Network warns that weight control measures are nowbeing takenby girls as young as 5 and 6. American statistics are similar.Several studies, such as one conducted by MarikaTiggemann and Levina Clark in2006 titled &quot;Appearance Culture in 9- to 12-Year-Old Girls: Media andPeerInfluences on Body Dissatisfaction,&quot; indicate that nearly half of allpreadolescent girls wish to be thinner, andas a result have engaged in a dietor are aware of the concept of dieting. In 2003, Teen magazine reported that35percent of girls 6 to 12 years old have been on at least one diet, and that 50to 70 percent of normal weightgirls believe they are overweight. Overallresearch indicates that 90% of women are dissatisfied with theirappearance insome way. Media activist Jean Kilbourne concludes that, &quot;Women are sold tothe diet industryby the magazines we read and the television programs we watch,almost all of which make us feel anxiousabout our weight.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　E. Perhaps the most disturbing is the fact that media images of femalebeauty are unattainable for all but a verysmall number of women. Researchersgenerating a computer model of a woman with Barbie-doll proportions,forexample, found that her back would be too weak to support the weight of herupper body, and her bodywould be too narrow to contain more than halfa liverand a few centimeters of bowel. A real woman built thatway would suffer fromchronic diarrhea ( 慢性腹泻. and eventually die frommalnutrition. Jill Barad,President of Mattel (which manufactures Barbie., estimated that 99% of girls aged 3 to 10 years old own atleast oneBarbie doll. Still, the number of real life women and girls who seek asimilarly underweight body isepidemic, and they can suffer equally devastatinghealth consequences. In 2006 it was estimated that up to450,000 Canadian womenwere affected by an eating disorder.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　F. Researchers report thatwomen's magazines have ten and one-half times more ads and articlespromotingweight loss than men's magazines do, and over three-quarters of thecovers of women's magazines include atleast one message about how to change awoman's bodily appearance--by diet, exercise or cosmetic surgery.Television andmovies reinforce the importance of a thin body as a measure of a woman's worth.Canadianresearcher Gregory Fouts reports that over three-quarters of the femalecharacters in TV situation comedies areunderweight, and only one in twenty areabove average in size. Heavier actresses tend to receive negativecomments frommale characters about their bodies (&quot;How about wearing a sack?&quot; ., and 80 percent of thesenegative comments are followed by cannedaudience laughter.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　G. There have been efforts in the magazine industry to buck (抵制，反抗. the trend. For several years the Quebecmagazine Coup de Pouce hasconsistently included full-sized women in their fashion pages and Chatelainehaspledged not to touch up photos and not to include models less than 25 yearsof age. In Madrid, one of theworld's biggest fashion capitals, ultra-thinmodels were banned from the runway in 2006. Furthermore Spainhas recentlyundergone a project with the aim to standardize clothing sizes through using aunique process inwhich a laser beam is used to measure real life women's bodiesin order to find the most tree to lifemeasurement.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　H. Another issue is the representation of ethnically diverse women inthe media. A 2008 study conducted byJuanita Covert and Travis Dixon titled&quot;A Changing View: Representation and Effects of the Portrayal ofWomen ofColor in Mainstream Women's Magazines&quot; found that although there was anincrease in therepresentation of women of c01our, overall white women wereoverrepresented in mainstream women'smagazines from 1999 to 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　I. The barrage of messagesabout thinness, dieting and beauty tells &quot;ordinary&quot; women that theyare always inneed of adjustment--and that the female body is an object to beperfected. Jean Kilboume argues that theoverwhelming presence of media imagesof painfully thin women means that real women's bodies have become invisible in the mass media。 The real tragedy, Kilbourne concludes, is that many womeninternalizethese stereotypes, and judge themselves by the beauty industry'sstandards. Women learn to comparethemselves to other women, and to compete withthem for male attention: This focus on beauty and desirability&quot;effectivelydestroys any awareness and action that might help to change that climate.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　根据以上内容，回答46-56题.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A report in Teen magazineshowed that 50% to 70% girls with normal weight think that they need to lose weight.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　47、On the whole, for 6 yearswhite women had been occupying much more space in mainstream women's magazines since 1999.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　48、Some negative effects suchas depression and unhealthy eating habits in females are related to their being exposed to images of thin and young femalebodies.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　49、The mass media has helpedboost the cosmetic and the diet industries.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　50、It is reported that thereis at least one message about the methods for women to change their bodilyappearance on more than three-quarters of the coversof women's magazines.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　51、Some film and televisionactresses even faint on the scene due to eating too little.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　52、Too much concern withappearance makes it impossible to change such abnormal trend.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　53、Researchers found that areal woman with Barbie-doll proportions would eventually die from malnutrition.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　54、The Quebec magazine Coup dePouce resists the trend by consistently including full-sized women in their fashion pages for several years.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　55、According to some analysts,the fundamental reason of imposing standards of beauty on women is economic　Section C</p>\n<p>\n\t　　56、Questions 56-61are based onthe following passage.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Is it possible to persuade mankind to livewithout war? War is an ancient institution which has existed for atleast sixthousand years. It was always bad and usually foolish, but in the past thehuman race managed to live withit. Modern ingenuity (创造力. has changed this. Either Man will abolishwar, or war will abolish Man. For thepresent, it is nuclear weapons that causethe most serious danger, but bacteriological or chemical weapons, maybeforelong, offer an even greater threat. If we succeed in abolishing nuclearweapons, our work will not be done. Itwill never be done until we havesucceeded in abolishing war. To do this, we need to persuade mankind tolookupon international questions in a new way, not as contests of forec, inwhich the victory goes to the side which ismost skillful in killing people, butby arbitration (调解. in accordance with agreedprinciples of law. It is not easyto change very old mental habits, but this iswhat must be attempted.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　There are those who say that the adoptionoft_his or that ideology would prevent war. I believe this to be a bigerror.All ideologies are based on dogmatic ( 教条式的. statements which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst,totallyfalse. Their adherents believe in them fanatically (狂热地. that they are willing to go to war in support ofthem.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Themovement of world opinion during the past few years has been very largely suchas we can welcome.

Of course very difficultproblemsremain in the world, but the spirit in which they are being approachedis a better one than it was some years ago. Ithas begun to be thought, even bythe powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that negotiations should reach agreements even if both sides donot find these agreements wholly satisfactory. It has begun to beunderstoodthat the important conflict nowadays is not between different countries, butbetween Man and the atombomb.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　This passage implies thatwar now is _________</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.worse than in the past</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.as badas in the past</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.not so dangerous as in the past</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.as necessary as in the past</p>\n<p>\n\t　　57、In the sentence &quot;To dothis, we need to persuade mankind... &quot;(Line 6, Para.1 ), &quot;this&quot; refers to _________</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.solving international problems</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.improving weapons</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.abolishing war</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.living a peaceful life</p>\n<p>\n\t　　58、From Paragraph 2 we learnthat the author of the passage</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.is a supporter of some modem ideologies</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.does not think that the adoption of any ideology could prevent war</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.believes that the adoption of some ideologies could prevent war</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.has no doubt about the truth of any ideologies</p>\n<p>\n\t　　59、The last paragraph suggeststhat_________</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.international agreements can be reached more easily now</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.man begins to realize the danger of nuclear war</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.nuclear war will definitely not take place</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.world opinion welcomes nuclear war</p>\n<p>\n\t　　60、According to theauthor,_________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.war is the only way to solve internatioual disputes</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.war will be less dangerous because of the improvement of weapons</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.it is impossible for man to live without war</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.war must be abolished if man wants to survive61、Questions{TSE} are based onthe following passage.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A useful definition of an air pollutantis a compound added directly or indirectly by humans to the atmospherein suchquantities as to affect humans, animals, vegetation, or material adversely (有害地.. Air pollution requires avery flexibledefinition that permits continuous change. When the first air pollution lawswere established inEngland in the fourteenth century, air pollutants werelimited to compounds that could be seen or smelled&mdash;a farcry (悬殊的差别. from the extensive list of harmful substances known today. Astechnology has developed andknowledge of the health aspects of variouschemicals has increased, the list of air pollutants has lengthened. Inthefuture, even water vapor (水蒸气. might be consideredan air pollutant under certain conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Many of the more important airpollutants, such as sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides,arefound in nature. As the Earth developed, the concentrations ( 浓度. of these pollutants were altered byvariouschemical reactions; they became components in biogeochemical (生物地球化学的. cycles. These serve as an airpurification scheme by allowing thecompounds to move from the air to the water or soil. On a global basis,nature'soutput of these compounds dwarfs that resulting from human activities. However,human productionusually occurs in a localized area, such as a city.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　In this localized region, human outputmay be dominant and may temporarily overload the natural purificationscheme ofthe cycles. The result is an increased concentration of noxious ( 有害的. chemicals in the air. Theconcentrations atwhich the adverse effects appear will be greater than the concentrations thatthe pollutants wouldhave in the absence of human activities. The actualconcentration need not be large for a substance to be apollutant; in fact thenumerical value tells us little until we know how much of an increase thisrepresents over the concentration that would occur naturally in the area. Forexample, sulfur dioxide has detectable health effects at0.08 parts per million(ppm., which is about 400 times its natural level.Carbon monoxide, however, has a naturallevel of 0.1 ppm and is not usually apollutant until its level reaches about 15 ppm.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　It can be inferred from thefirst paragraph that _________</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.water vapor is an air pollutant in localized areas</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.the definition of air pollution will continue to change</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.a substance becomes an air pollutant only in cities</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.most air pollutants today can be seen or smelled</p>\n<p>\n\t　　62、In what way can naturalpollutants play an important role in controlling air pollution?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.They function as part of a purification process.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.They are dwarfed by the pollutants produced by human activities.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.They are less harmful to living beings than are other pollutants.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.They have existed since the Earth developed.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　63、According to the passage,the numerical value Of the concentration level of a substance is only useful if</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.the other substances in the area are known</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.it is a localized area</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.it can be calculated quickly</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.the naturally occurring level is also known</p>\n<p>\n\t　　、Which of the following isbest supported by the passage?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.To effectively control pollution, local government should regularlyrevise the air pollution laws.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.One of the most important steps in preserving natural lands is tobetter enforce air pollution laws.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.Scientists should be consulted in order to establish uniform limitsfor all air pollutants.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.Human activities have great impact on air pollution.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　65、The passage mainlydiscusses _________</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.the economic impact on air pollution</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.how much damage air pollutants can cause</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.what constitutes an air pollutant</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.the quantity of compounds added to the atmosphere<br />\n\tPart IV Translation.(30minutes)</p>\n<p>\n\t　　66、北京有无数的胡[司(hutong)。平民百姓在胡同里的生活给古都北京带来了无穷的魅力。北京的胡同不仅仅是平民百姓的生活环境，而且还是一门建筑艺术。通常，胡同内有一个大杂院，房间够4到l0个家庭的差不多20口人住。所以，胡同里的生活充满了友善和人情味。如今，随着社会和经济的飞速发展，很多胡同被新的高楼大厦所取代。但愿胡同可以保留下来。</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">\n\t<strong>参考答案见下页~</strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">\n\t<strong>备考推荐：<a href=\"http://class.hujiang.com/17359962/intro?ch_source=ipo_en_0_rw&amp;editorid=842bc6fd\" target=\"_blank\">四级强化冲刺班</a></strong></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167411/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167411/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167411\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1126451/\">有声双语美文：人生这本书要一页一页读</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1159120/\">看完《花儿与少年》，我迷上了一个人练口语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167933/\">给工资都不要？世界上还有这样的国家？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p749165/\">英语四级作文：10个你想不到的总结句式</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1160201/\">Quora精选：怎样练成一口流利的英语？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1168339/\">《神奇女侠》创了世界纪录，女性导演的春天</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1161114/\">用手机学习的50种场合</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167042/\">欧盟要建免费Wi-fi，这还有没有王法了？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1154715/\">夏天到了，游泳必备的口语表达赶紧学起来！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167429/\">100年前的生活妙招：3种超有用的绳结</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Industry spending on advertising to children has exploded in the past decade, increasing from a mere $100 millidn in 1990 to more than $2 billion in 2000.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B. Parents today are willing to buy more for their kids because trends such as smaller family size, dual incomes and postponing children until later in life mean that families have more disposable income. As well, guilt can play a role in spending decisions as time-stressed parents substitute material goods for time spent with their kids. Here are some of the strategies marketers employ to target kids:Pester (纠缠) Power</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C. Today's kids have more autonomy and decision-making power within the family than in previous generations,so it follows that kids are vocal about what they want their parents to buy. &quot;Pester power&quot; refers to children's ability to nag their parents into purchasing items they may not otherwise buy. Marketing to children is all about creating pester power, because advertisers know what a powerful force it can be.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D. According to the 2001 marketing industry book Kid fluence, pestering or nagging can be divided into two categories--&quot;persistence&quot; and &quot;importance&quot;. Persistence nagging (a plea, that is repeated over and over again) is not as effective as the more sophisticated &quot;importance nagging&quot;. This latter method appeals to parents' desire to provide the best for their children, and plays on any guilt they may have about not having enough time for their kids.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The Marriage of Psychology and Marketing</p>\n<p>\n\t　　E. To effectively market to children, advertisers need to know what makes kids tick. With the help of well-paid researchers and psychologists, advertisers now have access to in-depth knowledge about children's developmental, emotional and social needs at different ages. Using research that analyzes children's behaviour, fantasy lives, art work, even their dreams, companies are able to craft sophisticated marketing strategies to reach young people.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　F. The issue of using child psychologists to help marketers target kids gained widespread public attention in 1999, when a group of U.S. mental health professionals issued a public letter to the American Psychological Association (APA) urging them to declare the practice unethical. The APA is currently studying the issue.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Building Brand Name Loyalty</p>\n<p>\n\t　　G. Canadian author Naomi Klein tracks the birth of &quot;brand&quot; marketing in her 2000 book No Logo. According to Klein, the mid-1980s saw the birth of a new kind of corporation--Nike, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, to name a few--which changed their primary corporate focus from producing products to creating an image for their brand name. By moving their manufacturing operations to countries with cheap labour, they freed up money to create their powerful marketing messages. It has been a tremendously profitable formula, and has led to the creation of some of the most wealthy and powerful multi-national corporations the world has seen.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　H.Marketers plant the seeds of brand recognition in very young children, in the hopes that the seeds will grow into lifetime relationships. According to the Center for a New American Dream, babies as young as six months of age can form mental images of corporate logos and mascots. Brand loyalties can be established as early as age two, and by the time children head off to school most can recognize hundreds of brand logos. While fast food, toy and clothing companies have been cultivating brand recognition in children for years, adult-oriented businesses such as banks and automakers are now getting in on the act.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Buzz or Street Marketing</p>\n<p>\n\t　　I. The challenge for marketers is to cut through the intense advertising clutter(杂乱) in young people's lives. Many companies are using &quot;buzz marketing&quot; --a new twist on the tried-and-true &quot;word of mouth&quot; method. The idea is to find the coolest kids in a community and have them use or wear your product in order to create a buzz around it. Buzz, or &quot;street marketing&quot;, as it's also called, can help a company to successfully connect with the elusive (难找的) teen market by using trendsetters to give them products &quot;cool&quot; status.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　J. Buzz marketing is particularly well-suited to the Interact, where young &quot;Net promoters&quot; use chat rooms and blogs to spread the word about music, clothes and other products among unsuspecting users.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Commercialization in Education</p>\n<p>\n\t　　K. School used to be a place where children were protected from the advertising and consumer messages that permeated their world--but not anymore. Budget shortfalls (亏空，差额) are forcing school boards to allow corporations access to students in exchange for badly needed cash, computers and educational materials.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　L. Corporations realize the power of the school environment for promoting their name and products. A school setting delivers a captive youth audience and implies the endorsement of teachers and the educational system. Marketers are eagerly exploiting this medium in a number of ways, including: 1 ) sponsored educational materials; 2) supplying schools with technology in exchange for high company visibility; 3) advertising posted in classrooms, school buses, on computers in exchange for funds; 4) contests and incentive programs: for example, the Pizza Hut reading incentives program in which children receive certificates for free pizza if they achieve a monthly reading goal; 5 ) sponsoring school events.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The Internet</p>\n<p>\n\t　　M. The Internet is an extremely desirable medium for marketers wanting to target children. It's part of youth culture. This generation of young people is growing up with the Interact as a daily and routine part of their lives. Kids are often online alone, without parental supervision. Unlike broadcasting media, which have codes regarding advertising to kids, the Interact is unregulated. Sophisticated technologies make it easy to collect information from young people for marketing research, and to target individual children with personalized advertising.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Marketing Adult Entertainment to Kids</p>\n<p>\n\t　　N . Children are often aware of and want to see entertainment meant for older audiences because it is actively marketed to them. In a report released in 2000, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) revealed how the movie, music and video games industries routinely market violent entertainment to young children.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　O.The FTC studied 44 films rated &quot;Restricted&quot;, and discovered that 80 per cent were targeted to children under</p>\n<p>\n\t　　17. Marketing plans included TV commercials run during hours when young viewers were most likely to be watching. The FTC report also highlighted the fact that toys based on characters from mature entertainment are often marketed to young children. Mature rated video games are advertised in youth magazines; and toys based on &quot;Restricted&quot; movies and M-rated video games are marketed to children as young as four.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Guilt can affect parents' spending decisions because they don't have enough time for their kids.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　47、The Center for a New American Dream pointed out that brand loyalties could be formed as early as age two.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　48、School boards allow corporations to access to students because they need money and educational materials badly.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　49、The FTC report highlighted the fact that toys based on characters from mature entertainment are often marketed to young children.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　50、For this generation of young people, the Internet is a daily and routine part of their lives.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　51、According to Kid fluence, &quot;persistence nagging&quot; is less effective than the more sophisticated &quot;importance nagging&quot;.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　52、According to a report released by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the movie, music and video games industries usually market violent entertainment to young children.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　53、Buzz marketing is well-suited to the Internet because the interactive environment can spread messages effectively.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　54、A group of U.S. mental health professionals think that it is unethical to use child psychologists to help marketers target kids.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　55、According to the Pizza Hut reading incentives program, children will receive certificates for free pizza if they achieve a monthly reading goal.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Section C</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.

Recently, however, I was disappointed to see that it also decides how I'm treated as a person.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Last year I left a professional position as a small-town reporter and took a job waiting tables. As someone paid to serve food to people, I had customers say and do things to me I suspect they'd never say or do to their most casual acquaintances. One night a man talking on his cell phone waved me away, then beckoned (示意) me back with his finger a minute later, complaining he was ready to order and asking where I'd been.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　I had waited tables during summers in college and was treated like apeon (勤杂工) by plenty of people. But at 19 years old, I believed I deserved inferior treatment from professional adults. Besides, people responded to me differently after I told them I was in college. Customers would joke that one day I'd be sitting at their table, waiting to be served.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Once I graduated I took a job at a community newspaper. From my first day, I heard a respectful tone from everyone who called me. I assumed this was the way the professional world worked--cordially.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　I soon found out differently. I sat several feet away from an advertising sales representative with a similar name. Our calls would often get mixed up and someone asking for Kristen would be transferred to Christie. The mistake was immediately evident. Perhaps it was because money was involved, but people used a tone with Kristen that they never used with me.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　My job title made people treat me with courtesy. So it was a shock to return to the restaurant industry.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　It's no secret that there's a lot to put up with when waiting tables, and fortunately, much of it can be easily forgotten when you pocket the tips. The service industry, by definition, exists to cater to others' needs. Still, it seemed that many of my customers didn't get the difference between server and servant.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　I'm now applying to graduate school, which means someday I'll return to a profession where people need to be nice to me in order to get what they want. I think I'll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The author was disappointed to find that _______.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.one's position is used as a gauge to measure one's intelligence</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.talented people like her should fail to get a respectable job</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.one's occupation affects the way one is treated as a person</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.professionals tend to look down upon manual workers</p>\n<p>\n\t　　57、What does the author intend to say by the example in the second paragraph?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.Some customers simply show no respect to those who serve them.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.People absorbed in a phone conversation tend to be absent-minded.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.Waitresses are often treated by customers as casual acquaintances.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.Some customers like to make loud complaints for no reason at all.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　58、 How did the author feel when waiting tables at the age of 19?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.She felt it unfair to be treated as a mere servant by professionals.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.She felt badly hurt when her customers regarded her as a peon.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.She was embarrassed each time her customers joked with her.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.She found it natural for professionals to treat her as inferior.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　59、What does the author imply by saying &quot;... many of my customers didn't get the difference between server and　servant&quot; ( Line 3, Para. 7)?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.Those who cater to others' needs are destined to be looked down upon.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.Those working in the service industry shouldn't be treated as servants.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.Those serving others have to put up with rough treatment to earn a living.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.The majority of customers tend to look on a servant as a server nowadays.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　60、The author says she'll one day take her clients to dinner in order to ________</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.see what kind of person they are</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.experience the feeling of being served</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.show her generosity towards people inferior to her</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.arouse their sympathy for people living a humble life</p>\n<p>\n\t　　61、<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">根据下列短文，回答下面各题。</span></p>\n<p>\n\t　　What's hot for 2007 among the very rich? A $7.3 million diamond ring. A trip to Tanzania to hunt wild animals. Oh, and income inequality.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Sure, some leftish billionaires like George Soros have been railing against income inequality for years. But increasingly, centrist and right-wing billionaires are starting to worry about income inequality and the fate of the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　In December, Mortimer Zuckerman wrote a column in U.S. News & World Report, which he owns. &quot;Our nation's core bargain with the middle class is disintegrating,&quot; lamented (哀叹) the 117th-richest man in America.&quot;Most of our economic gains have gone to people at the very top of the income ladder. Average income for a household of people of working age, by contrast, has fallen five years in a row.&quot; He noted that &quot;Tens of millions of Americans live in fear that a major health problem can reduce them to bankruptcy.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Wilbur Ross Jr. has echoed Zuckerman's anger over the bitter struggles faced by middle-class Americans. &quot;It's an outrage that any American's life expectancy should be shortened simply because the company they worked for went bankrupt and ended health-care coverage,&quot; said the former chairman of the International Steel Group.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　What's happening? The very rich are just as trendy as you and I, and can be so when it comes to politics and policy. Given the recent change of control in Congress, the popularity of measures like increasing the minimum wage, and efforts by California's governor to offer universal health care, these guys don't need their own personal weathermen to know which way the wind blows.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　It's possible that plutocrats (有钱有势的人) are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory (没收性的) tax policies. But the prospect that income inequality will lead to higher taxes on the wealthy doesn't keep plutocrats up at night. They can live with that.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　No, what they fear was that the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the United States because of what has happened to the distribution of income and economic insecurity.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　In other words, if middle-class Americans continue to struggle financially as the ultrawealthy grow ever wealthier, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain political support for the free flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. And when the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it's likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. For people who buy and sell companies, or who allocate capital to markets all around the world, that's the real nightmare.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　What is the current topic of common interest among the very rich in America?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.The fate of the ultrawealthy people.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.The disintegration of the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.The inequality in the distribution of wealth.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.The conflict between the left and the right wing.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　62、What do we learn from Mortimer Zuckerman's lamentation?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.Many middle-income families have failed to make a bargain for better welfare.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.The American economic system has caused many companies to go bankrupt.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.The American nation is becoming more and more divided despite its wealth.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.The majority of Americans benefit little from the nation's growing wealth.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　63、From the fifth paragraph we can learn that _________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.the very rich are fashion-conscious</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.the very rich are politically sensitive</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.universal health care is to be implemented throughout America</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.Congress has gained popularity by increasing the minimum wage</p>\n<p>\n\t　　、What is the real reason for plutocrats to express solidarity with the middle class?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.They want to protect themselves from confiscatory taxation.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.They know that the middle class contributes most to society.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.They want to gain support for global economic integration.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.They feel increasingly threatened by economic insecurity.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　65、What may happen if the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.The prices of imported goods will inevitably soar beyond control.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.The investors will have to make great efforts to reallocate capital.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.The wealthy will attempt to buy foreign companies across borders.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.Foreign countries will place the same economic barriers in return.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>参考答案见下页~</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">备考推荐：<a href=\"http://class.hujiang.com/17355373/intro?ch_source=ipo_en_0_rw&amp;editorid=842bc6fd\" target=\"_blank\">六级强化冲刺班</a></strong></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167414/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167414/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167414\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1126451/\">有声双语美文：人生这本书要一页一页读</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1159120/\">看完《花儿与少年》，我迷上了一个人练口语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167933/\">给工资都不要？世界上还有这样的国家？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p749165/\">英语四级作文：10个你想不到的总结句式</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1160201/\">Quora精选：怎样练成一口流利的英语？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1168339/\">《神奇女侠》创了世界纪录，女性导演的春天</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1161114/\">用手机学习的50种场合</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167042/\">欧盟要建免费Wi-fi，这还有没有王法了？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1154715/\">夏天到了，游泳必备的口语表达赶紧学起来！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1167429/\">100年前的生活妙招：3种超有用的绳结</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Many college students have no concept of thrift in their mind at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe following factors contribute to this excess spending. First of all, as the only child of their families, many students are the apples in their families' eyes and naturally get more care and pocket money. Some are even spoiled and take spending money from their parents for granted. In addition, with the improvement of living standards, parents can also afford higher expenditure of their children. Moreover, some students like to pursue fashion and trends, which can be quite costly. Finally, campus love is another possible factor causing too much spending.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom my point of view, college students should learn to be thrifty. We should limit our expenditure on daily necessities but not buy whatever we want regardless of their prices. The habit of thrift can help us form fight values and is favorable to our future development.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">参考范文二</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tCollege&nbsp;Students&nbsp;and&nbsp;Luxuries</p>\n<p>\n\tWalking&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;campus,&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll&nbsp;find&nbsp;luxuries&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;far&nbsp;away&nbsp;for&nbsp;students.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;wear&nbsp;CK&nbsp;clothes&nbsp;and&nbsp;some&nbsp;carry&nbsp;LV&nbsp;bags.&nbsp;According&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;online&nbsp;survey&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;by&nbsp;Tencent&nbsp;in&nbsp;May&nbsp;this&nbsp;year,&nbsp;there&nbsp;are&nbsp;37&nbsp;percent&nbsp;students&nbsp;claiming&nbsp;to&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain&nbsp;luxury.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn&nbsp;the&nbsp;basis&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;survey,&nbsp;the&nbsp;way&nbsp;of&nbsp;obtaining&nbsp;luxuries&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite&nbsp;different.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;students&nbsp;get&nbsp;them&nbsp;from&nbsp;their&nbsp;parents,&nbsp;as&nbsp;their&nbsp;families&nbsp;are&nbsp;in&nbsp;good&nbsp;financial&nbsp;condition.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;take&nbsp;part-time&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;to&nbsp;buy&nbsp;luxuries&nbsp;by&nbsp;themselves.&nbsp;For&nbsp;example,&nbsp;a&nbsp;college&nbsp;student&nbsp;named&nbsp;Xiao&nbsp;Mei&nbsp;said&nbsp;she&nbsp;worked&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tutor&nbsp;for&nbsp;three&nbsp;months&nbsp;in&nbsp;order&nbsp;to&nbsp;get&nbsp;a&nbsp;bottle&nbsp;of&nbsp;Dior&nbsp;perfume.Some&nbsp;receive&nbsp;luxuries&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift&nbsp;from&nbsp;their&nbsp;friends&nbsp;or&nbsp;relatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs&nbsp;for&nbsp;me,&nbsp;I&nbsp;object&nbsp;to&nbsp;students'&nbsp;using&nbsp;luxuries.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is&nbsp;known&nbsp;that&nbsp;luxuries&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;able&nbsp;for&nbsp;their&nbsp;super&nbsp;prices.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;students&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;economically&nbsp;independent&nbsp;and&nbsp;their&nbsp;attention&nbsp;should&nbsp;be&nbsp;paid&nbsp;to&nbsp;study.&nbsp;In this&nbsp;sense,&nbsp;using&nbsp;luxuries&nbsp;is&nbsp;improper&nbsp;for&nbsp;students.</p>\n<p>\n\t怎么样？这两篇六级冲刺范文你记住了吗？现在大学生消费正是社会讨论的热点问题，这类话题很容易成为考题，希望大家重视起来哦。预祝大家取得好成绩！</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">备考推荐：<a href=\"http://class.hujiang.com/17355373/intro?ch_source=ipo_en_0_rw&amp;editorid=842bc6fd\" target=\"_blank\">六级强化冲刺班</a></strong></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167037/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1167037\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1103523/\">有声双语美文：这样的慰藉就够了，就是幸福</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1168862/\">看到今年的高考作文题...还好我毕业早！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1168882/\">让我爱上卷福的不是《神探夏洛克》，而是他</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1169299/\">苹果世界开发者大会全解析~ Apple又出了啥?</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p777439/\">“惊”艳你：歪果仁最喜欢的惊悚小说Top 8</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1159120/\">看完《花儿与少年》，我迷上了一个人练口语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1161112/\">表达感情的15个高级短语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1168332/\">日本公司发明炫酷机械臂，你现在有四只手了</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p960042/\">2017年6月英语六级作文预测(二)：嫉妒</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1149007/\">关于all的短语和表达</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

The radio signals discussed in this passage____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.were regular B.were controlled by a clock</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.were heard in 1967 only D.were secret messages</p>\n<p>\n\t　　22. The radio singals were sent by____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.a satellite B.a planet</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.a sky body which was unknown at that time</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.intelligent beings who were unknown at that time</p>\n<p>\n\t　　23. The scientists did not tell people about the signals because____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.the singals stood for secret messages</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.people would ask them too many questions</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.they did not want to frighten people</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.they stood for unimportant messages</p>\n<p>\n\t　　24. A pulsar is____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A. a small heavy star which sends out strong radio signals and cannot be seen</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B. a small heavy planet which sends out strong radio signals and cannot be seen</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C. a small heavy satellite which sends out strong radio signals and cannot be seen</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D. a small intelligent being who sends out strong radio signals and cannot be seen</p>\n<p>\n\t　　25. Which of the following is true?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.One of the pulsars found by scientists sends radio signals.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.Pulsar began to send radio singals in 1967.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.Scientists have searched for pulsars for many years but found none.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.Scientists have found many pulsars since 1967.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　rn life and ancient life.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　27. &ldquo;one out of seven&rdquo; refers to____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.more than a third of the lands' earth</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.the percentage of the earth's land that is desert-like</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.the number of people who live in dry regions</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.a day of a week</p>\n<p>\n\t　　28. In paragraph 2,&ldquo;they are taken to the greener lands in the south.&rdquo;They　refers to____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.the Sahel farm land B.the farmers</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.the cattles D.the trees</p>\n<p>\n\t　　29. How many ideas for saving the land are described?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.Five. B.Two.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.Four. D.Three.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　30. Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.The earth's desert are slowly spreading.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.One out of 10 people lives in dry regions.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.Their life in the desert is threatened now by traditional problems.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.New water wells can solve the problem in Africa's desert.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Telephone, television, radio, and telegraph all help people communicate with　each other. Because of these devices, ideas and news of events spread quickly all　over the world. For example, within seconds, people can know the results of an　election in another country. An international football match comes into the homes　of everyone with a television set.News of a disaster such as an earthquake or a　flood can bring help from distant countries within hours, help is on the way. Because of modern technology like the satellites that travel around the world, information travels fast.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　How has this speed of communication changed the world? To many people,the world has become smaller. Of course this does not mean that the world is actually physically smaller. It means that the world seems smaller. Two hundred years ago,communication between the continents took a long time. All news was carried on ships that took weeks or even months to cross the ocean. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,it took six weeks for news from Europe to reach America.This time difference influenced people's actions. For example, one battle, or fight, in the War of 1812 between England and the United States could have been avoided. A peace agreement had already been signed. Peace was made in England, but the news of peace took six weeks to reach America. During these six weeks, the large and serious Battle of New Orleans was fought. Many people lost their lives after a peace treaty had been signed.They would not have died if news had come in time.In the past,communication took much time than it does now.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　There was a good reason why the world seemed so much larger than it does today.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　31. News spreads fast because of____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.modern transportation B.new technology</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.the change of the world D.a peace agreement</p>\n<p>\n\t　　32. According to this passage,____is very important to people in a disaster area.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.fast communication B.modern technology</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.latest news D.new ideas</p>\n<p>\n\t　　33. Which of the following statements is true?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.The world now seems smaller because of faster communication.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.The world is actually smaller today.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.The world is changing its size.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D. The distance between England and America has changed since the War of 1812</p>\n<p>\n\t　　34. Two hundred years ago,news between the continents was carried____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.by telephone and telegraph B.by land</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.by air D.by sea</p>\n<p>\n\t　　35. The New Orleans Battle could have been avoided if the peace agreement had been signed____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.by both sides B.in time</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.in America D.in England</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The concept of personal choice in relation to health behaviors is an important one.An estimated 90 percent of all illnesses may be preventable if individuals would make sound personal health choices based upon current medical knowledge.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　We all enjoy our freedom of choice and do not like to see it restricted when it is within the legal and moral boundaries of society.[ZZ)]The structure of American society allows us to make almost all our own personal decisions that may concern our health.If we so desire,we can smoke,drink excessively, refuse to wear seat　belts,eat whatever foods we want,and live a completely sedentary life-style without any excuse.The freedom to make such personal decisions is a fundamental aspect of our society,although the wisdom of these decisions can be questioned.Personal choices relative to health often cause a difficulty.As one example,a teenager may know the facts relative to smoking cigarettes and health but may be pressured by friends into believing it is the socially accepted thing to do. A multitude of factors,both inherited and environmental,influence the development of heal threlated behaviors,and it is beyond the scope of this text to discuss all these factors as they may affect any given individual.However,the decision to adopt a particular health-related behavior is usually one of personal choices.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　There are healthy choices and there are unhealthy choices.In discussing the moral of personal choice,Fries and Crapo drew a comparison.[ZZ(Z]They suggest that to knowingly give oneself over to a behavior that has a statistical probability of shortening life is similar to attempting suicide.[ZZ)]Thus,for those individuals　who are interested in preserving both the quality and quantity of life,personal health choices should reflect those behaviors that are associated with statistical probability of increased vitality and longevity.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　36. The concept of personal choice concerning health is important because____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.personal health choices help cure most illnesses</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.it helps raise the level of our medical knowledge</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.it is essential to personal freedom in American society</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.wrong decisions could head to poor health</p>\n<p>\n\t　　37. To &ldquo;live a completely sedentary life style&rdquo;(Para. 1) in the passage means____.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.to live an inactive life B.to live a decent life</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.to live a life with complete freedom</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.to live a life of vice</p>\n<p>\n\t　　38. Sound personal health choice is often difficult to make because____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.current medical knowledge is still insufficient</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.there are many factors influencing our decisions</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.few people are willing to trade the quality of life for longevity</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.people are usually influenced by the behavior of their friends</p>\n<p>\n\t　　39. To knowingly allow oneself to pursue unhealthy habits is compared by Fries and Crapo to____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A.improving the quality of one's life</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B.limiting one's personal health choice</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C.deliberately ending one's life</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D.breaking the rules of social behavior</p>\n<p>\n\t　　40.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　There are two methods of fighting, the one by law, the other by force; the first　method is that of men, the second of beasts; but as the first method is often　insufficient, one must have recourse to the second. It is, therefore, necessary　for a prince to know well how to use both the beast and the man. This was covertly taught to rulers by ancient writers, who related how Achilles and many others　of those ancient princes were given to Chiron the centaur to be brought up and educated under his discipline. The parable of this semi animal, semi human teacher is meant to indicate that a prince must know how to use both natures, and that the one without the other is not durable. A prince, being thus obliged to know well how to act as a beast, must imitate the fox, and the lion, for the lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox annot defend himself from wolves. Those that wish to be only lions do not understand this. Therefore, a prudent ruler ought not to keep faith when by doing so　it would be against his interest, and when the reasons which made him bind himself no longer exist. If men were all good, this precept would not be good ; but　as they are bad, and would not observe their faith with you, so you are not bound to keep faith with them. Nor have legitimate grounds ever failed a prince who　wished to show colorable excuse for the nonfulfilment of his promise. Of this one could furnish an infinite number of examples, and show how many times peace has been broken, and how many promises rendered worthless, by the faithlessness of princes, and those that have best been able to imitate the fox have succeeded best. But it is necessary to be able to disguise this character well, and to be a great feigner and dissembler, and men are so simple and so ready to obey present necessities, that the one who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　21.The author of the passage does not believe that ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) people can protect themselves</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) the truth makes men free</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) leaders have to be consistent</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) princes are human</p>\n<p>\n\t　　22.The lion represents those who are ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) too trusting B) strong and careful</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) reliant on force D) lacking in intelligence</p>\n<p>\n\t　　23.The fox, in this passage, is ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) admired for his trickery B) no match for the lion</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) pitied for his trick D) considered worthless</p>\n<p>\n\t　　24.The writer suggests that a successful leader must ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) be prudent and faithful</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) cheat and lie</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) have principle to guide his actions</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) tell the people the truth about his opponent</p>\n<p>\n\t　　25.The writer would approve an unsuccessful political candidate ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) gave up all his opportunities</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) promised to try again next time</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) overthrew the government by force</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) told the people the truth about his opponent</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The forest from which Man takes his timber is the tallest and most impressive plant community on Earth. In terms of Man's brief life it appears permanent and unchanging, save for the seasonal growth and fall of the leaves, but to forester it represents the climax of a long succession of events. No wooded landscape we see today has been forest for all time. Plants have minimum requirements of temperature and moisture and, in ages past, virtually every part of Earth's surface has at some time been either too dry or too cold for plants to survive. However, as soon as climatic conditions change in favour of plant life, a fascinating sequence of changes occurs, called a primary succession.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　First to colonize the barren land are the lowly lichens, surviving on bare rock.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Slowly, the acids produced by these organisms crack the rock surface, plant debris accumulates, and mosses establish a shallow root?hold. Ferns may follow and, with short grasses and shrubs, gradually form a covering of plant life. Roots probe even deeper into the developing soil and eventually large shrubs give way to the first trees. These grow rapidly, cutting off sunlight from the smaller plants, and soon establish complete domination&mdash;closing their ranks and forming a climax community which may endure for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Yet even this community is not everlasting. Fire may destroy it outright and settlers may cut it down to gain land for pasture or cultivation. If the land is then abandoned, a secondary succession will take over, developing much faster on the more hospitable soil. Shrubs and trees are among the early invaders, their seeds carried by the wind, by birds and lodged in the coats of mammals.For as long as it stands and thrives, the forest is a vast machine, storing energy and many elements essential for life.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　26.What does the forest strike mankind as permanent?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) The trees are in community.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) The forest is renewed each season.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) Man's life is short in comparison.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) It is an essential part our lives.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　27.What has sometimes caused plants to die out of the past?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) Interference from foresters.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) Variations in climate.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) The absence of wooded land.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) The introduction of new type of plants.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　28.In a &ldquo;primary succession', what makes it possible for mosses to take root?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) The type of rock.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) The amount of sunlight.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) The amount of moisture.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) The effect of lichens.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　29.What conditions are needed for shrubs to become established?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) Ferns must take root.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) The ground must be covered with grass.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) More soil must accumulate.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) Smaller plants must die out.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　30.Why is a &ldquo;secondary succession&rdquo; quicker?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) The ground is more suitable.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) There is more space for new plants.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) Birds and animals bring new seeds.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) It is supported by the forest.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Grandma Moses is among the most celebrated twentieth century painters of the United States, yet she had barely started painting before she was in her late seventies. As she once said of herself: &ldquo;I would never sit back in a rocking chair, waiting for someone to help me.&rdquo; No one could have had a more productive age.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　She was born Anna Mary Robertson on a farm in New York State, one of five boys and five girls.(&ldquo;We came in bunches, like radishes.&rdquo;) At twelve she left home and was in domestic service until, at twenty seven, she married Thomas Moses, the hired hand of one of her employers. They farmed most of their lives, first in Virginia and then in New York State, at Eagle Bridge. She had ten children, of whom five survived; her husband died in 1927. Grandma Moses painted a little as a child and made embroidery pictures as a hobby, but only switched to oils in old age because her hands had become too stiff to sew and she wanted to keep busy and pass the time. Her pictures were first sold at the local drugstore and at a fair, and were soon spotted by a dealer who bought everything she painted. Three of the pictures were exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, and in 1940 she had her first exhibition in New York. Between the 1930's and her death she produced some 2,000 pictures: detailed and lively portrayals of the rural life she had known for so long, with a marvelous sense of color and form. &ldquo;I think really hard till I think of something really pretty, and then I paint it.&rdquo;she said.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　31.Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) Grandma Moses: A Biographical Sketch</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) The Children of Grandma Moses</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) Grandma Moses: Her Best Exhibition</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) Grandma Moses and Other Older Artists</p>\n<p>\n\t　　32.According to the passage, Grandma Moses began to paint because she wanted to ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) decorate her home</p>\n<p>\n\t　　B) keep active</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) improve her salary</p>\n<p>\n\t　　D) gain an international reputation</p>\n<p>\n\t　　33.From Grandma Moses' description of herself in the first paragraph, it can be inferred that she was ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) independent B) pretty</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) wealthy D) timid</p>\n<p>\n\t　　34.Grandma Moses spent most of her life ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) nursing B) painting</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) embroidering D) farming</p>\n<p>\n\t　　35.In line 14, the word &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; could best be replaced by ____.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A) speckled B) featured</p>\n<p>\n\t　　C) noticed D) damaged</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The producers of instant coffee found their product strongly resisted in the market places despite their manifest (明显的) advantages. Furthermore, the advertising expenditure for instant coffee was far greater than that for regular coffee.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Efforts were made to find the cause of the consumers' seemingly unreasonable resistance to the product. The reason given by most people was dislike for the taste. The producers suspected that there might be deeper reasons, however. This was confirmed by one of motivation research's classic studies, one often cited in the trade. Mason Haire, of the University of California, constructed two shopping lists that were identical except for one item. There were six items common to both lists: hamburger, carrots(胡萝卜), baking powder, bread, canned peaches and　　potatoes, with the brands or amounts specified. The seventh item, in the fifth place on both lists, read &ldquo;11b. Maxwell House coffee&rdquo; on one list and &ldquo;Nescafe instant coffee&rdquo; on the other. One list was given to each person in a group of fifty women, and the other list to those in another group of the same size. The women were asked to study their lists and then to describe, as far as they could, the kind of woman (&ldquo;personality and character&rdquo;) who would draw up that shopping list. Nearly half of those who had received the list including instant coffee described a housewife who was lazy and a poor planner. On the other hand, only one woman in the other group described the housewife, who had included regular coffee on her list, as lazy; only six of that group suggested that she was a poor planner. Eight women felt that the instant coffee user was probably not a good wife!

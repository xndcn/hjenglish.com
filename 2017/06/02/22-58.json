Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Passage One</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a difference between science and technology. Science is a method of answering theoretical questions; technology is a method of solving practical problems. Science has to do with discovering the facts and relationships between observable phenomena in nature and with establishing theories that serve to organize these facts and relationships; technology has to do with tools, techniques, and procedures for implementing the finding of science.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother distinction between science and technology has to do with the progress in each.</p>\n<p>\n\tProgress in science excludes the human factor. Scientists, who seek to comprehend the universe and know the truth within the highest degree of accuracy and certainty, cannot pay attention to their own or other people's likes or dislikes or to popular ideas about the fitness of things. What scientists discover may shock or anger people-as did Darwin's theory of evolution. But even an unpleasant truth is more than likely to be useful; besides, we have the choice of refusing to believe it! But hardly so with technology; we do not have the choice of refusing to hear the sonic boom produced by a supersonic aircraft flying overhead; we do not have the option of refusing to breathe polluted air; and we do not have the option of living in a non-atomic age. Unlike science progress, technology must be measured in terms of the human factor. The legitimate purpose of technology is to serve people in general, not merely some people; and future generations, not merely those who presently wish to gain advantage for themselves. Technology must be humanistic if it is to lead to a better world.</p>\n<p>\n\t21. The difference between science and technology lies in that _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) the former provides answers to theoretical questions while the latter to practical problems</p>\n<p>\n\tB) the former seeks to comprehend the universe while the latter helps change the material world</p>\n<p>\n\tC) the former aims to discover the inter-connections of facts and the rules that explain them while the latter, to discover new designs and ways of making the things we use in our daily life</p>\n<p>\n\tD) all of the above</p>\n<p>\n\t22. Which of the following may be representative of science?</p>\n<p>\n\tA) The improvement of people's life.</p>\n<p>\n\tB) The theory of people's life.</p>\n<p>\n\tC) Farming tools.</p>\n<p>\n\tD) Mass production.</p>\n<p>\n\t23. According to the author, scientific theories _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) must be strictly objective</p>\n<p>\n\tB) usually take into consideration people's likes and dislikes</p>\n<p>\n\tC) should conform to popular opinions</p>\n<p>\n\tD) always appear in perfect and finished forms</p>\n<p>\n\t24. The author states that technology itself _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) is responsible for widespread pollution and resource exhaustion</p>\n<p>\n\tB) should serve those who wish to gain advantage for themselves</p>\n<p>\n\tC) will lead to a better world if put to wise use</p>\n<p>\n\tD) will inevitably be for bad purpose</p>\n<p>\n\t25. The tone of the author in this passage is _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) positive</p>\n<p>\n\tB) negative</p>\n<p>\n\tC) factual</p>\n<p>\n\tD) critical</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Passage Two</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmericans have always been ambivalent in their attitudes toward education. On the one hand, free and universal public education was seen as necessary in a democracy, for how else would citizens learn how to govern themselves in a responsible way? On the other hand, America was always a country that offered financial opportunities for which education was not needed: on the road from rags to riches, schooling-beyond the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic-was an unnecessary detour.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven today, it is still possible for people to achieve financial success without much education, but the number of situations in which this is possible is decreasing. In today's more complex world, the opportunities for financial success is closely related to the need for education, especially higher education.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur society is rapidly becoming one whose chief product is information, and dealing with this information requires more and more specialized education. In other words, we grow up learning more and more about fewer and fewer subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the future, this trend is likely to continue. Tomorrow's world will be even more complex than today's world, and, to manage this complexity, even more specialized education will be needed.</p>\n<p>\n\t26. The topic treated in this passage is _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) education in general</p>\n<p>\n\tB) Americans' attitudes</p>\n<p>\n\tC) higher education</p>\n<p>\n\tD) American education</p>\n<p>\n\t27. Americans' attitudes toward education have always been _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) certain B) contradictory</p>\n<p>\n\tC) ambitious D) unclear</p>\n<p>\n\t28. Today, financial success is closely related to the need for _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) higher education B) public education</p>\n<p>\n\tC) responsible citizens D) learning the basics</p>\n<p>\n\t29. It can be inferred from the third paragraph that _____.</p>\n<p>\n\tA) information is our only product</p>\n<p>\n\tB) education in the future will be specialized</p>\n<p>\n\tC) we are entering an age of information</p>\n<p>\n\tD) we are living in an age of information</p>\n<p>\n\t30. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?</p>\n<p>\n\tA) The History of American Education.</p>\n<p>\n\tB) The Need for Specialized Education.</p>\n<p>\n\tC) The Future of the American Educational System.</p>\n<p>\n\tD) Attitudes toward American Education.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>参考答案：</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">21.

In ancient times unwanted children were occasionally abandoned, put to death, exploiting or offered for religious sacrifices, and in any event a large percentage of them didn&rsquo;t survive their physically hazardous existence to reach to maturity.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn western civilization within the last few hundred years, there have been many changes in attitude with the young. In agricultural Europe, and later with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the children of the poor work long hours for little or no pay, and there was no public concern on their safety or welfare punishment could be brutal and severe.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy the eighteenth century the harsh and severe methods began to show any change. Society slowly accorded(给予) children a role of importance. Books were written expressly for them and gradually laws were passing for their protection. Efforts were made to create for them a life better than their parents!</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the past few decades parents have become more and more attentive for the needs of their children.Better health care is available and education is no longer reserving for the children from wealthy families.</p>\n<p>\n\t71. ______<br />\n\t72. ______<br />\n\t73. ______<br />\n\t74. ______<br />\n\t75. ______<br />\n\t76. ______<br />\n\t77. ______<br />\n\t78. ______<br />\n\t79. ______<br />\n\t80. ______</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Writing (30 minutes)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDirections: For this part, you are allowed to write a composition on the topic On Part-time Jobs.

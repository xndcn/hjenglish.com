You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center .</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion 21 to 35 are based on the following passage .<br />\n\tThe beat generation mainly referred to the youth who were born and brought up around the Second World War . They showed their disdain ( ) for almost everything traditional , such as government authority , respect for parents , one&rsquo;s duty , moral standards , and traditional customs . They developed a kind of absolute individualism and liberty. They preferred long hair , minidresses or close-fitting clothes to show off the figure . They advocated freedom of sex and cohabitation ( ) . Their influence could be seen from the fact that about one third of the American couples living together were not married by law . And the divorce rate was very high . The endless U.S wars abroad and sharp class struggle at home caused many American youths to develop a kind of cynicism . They doubted the existing social system , possibility of harmonious human relations , and the long-honored standard for correct behavior . They felt society overlooked their needs . Therefore , they refused to do any duty that was required of them by society . They declared &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe anyone over thirty .&rdquo; All this came from the sick society . It&rsquo;s wrong to imagine they all fought against capitalism in support of revolutionary things . Some of their ideas were even more decadent () and impractical . It was an abnormal phenomenon in an abnormal society.</p>\n<p>\n\t21. Based on the passage , how many of one hundred and twenty American couples of the beat generation practiced cohabitation .<br />\n\tA)about 20 couples B) about 40 couples C) about 60 couples D) about 30 couples</p>\n<p>\n\t22. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage ?<br />\n\tA)The beat generation refused to do any duty<br />\n\tB)The beat generation was in support of almost everything traditional .<br />\n\tC)The beat generation believes no one except that he is over thirty .<br />\n\tD)The beat generation&rsquo;s ideas were not impractical .</p>\n<p>\n\t23. &ldquo;Cynicism&rdquo; in this passage most probably means ______.<br />\n\tA)a state of mind against realism<br />\n\tB) a state of mind doubting everything in existence.<br />\n\tC)a theory advocating mutual help<br />\n\tD)a theory advocating individualism</p>\n<p>\n\t24. The reason why the beat generation refused to cooperate with society was ____.<br />\n\tA) they had no interest B) they found hard to cooperation with it<br />\n\tC)the laws block their way to do so . D) they thought their need was neglected .</p>\n<p>\n\t25. This passage is mainly about _____.<br />\n\tA)the young Americans B) the generation gap .<br />\n\tC)the education of the young D) an American social phenomenon</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestion 26 to 30 are based on the following passage .</p>\n<p>\n\tTress should only be pruned when there is a good and clear reason for doing so and , the number of such reasons is small . Pruning involves the cutting away of overgrown and unwanted branches , and the inexperienced gardener can be encouraged by the thought that more damage results from doing it unnecessarily than from the tree to grow in its own way .<br />\n\tFirst , pruning may be done to make sure that trees have a desired shape or size . The object may be to get a tree of the right height , and at the same time to help the growth of small side branches , which will thicken its appearance or give it a special shape . Secondly , pruning may be done to make the tree heavier . You may cut out diseased or dead wood , or branches that are rubbing against each other and thus cause wounds . The health of a tree may be encouraged by removing branches that are blocking up the center and so preventing the free movement of air . One result of pruning is that an open wound is left on the tree and this provides an easy entry for disease , but it is a wound that will heal . Often there is a race between the healing and the disease as to whether the tree will live or die , so that there is a period when the tree is at risk . It should be the aim of every gardener to reduce that risk of death as far as possible . It is essential to make the area , which has been pruned smooth , and clean , for healing will be slowed down by roughness . You should allow the cut surface to dry for a few hours and then paint it with one of the substances available from garden shops especially for this purpose . Pruning is usually done in winter , for then you can see the shape of the tree clearly without interference from the leaves and also it is very unlikely that the cuts you make will bleed . If this does happen , it is , of course , impossible to paint them properly .</p>\n<p>\n\t26. Pruning should be done to _____.<br />\n\tA)make the tree grow taller . B) does not protect them form the wind<br />\n\tC)get rid of the small branches D) make the small branches thicker .</p>\n<p>\n\t27. Trees become unhealthy if the gardener_______<br />\n\tA)allows too many branches to grow in the middle<br />\n\tB)does not protect them from the wind<br />\n\tC)forces them grow too quickly<br />\n\tD)damages some of the small side branches.</p>\n<p>\n\t28 . Why is a special substance painted on the tree ?<br />\n\tA)to make a wound smooth .<br />\n\tB)to prevent disease entering a wound .<br />\n\tC)to cover a rough surface .<br />\n\tD) to help a wound to dry .</p>\n<p>\n\t29. A good gardener prunes tree ____<br />\n\tA) at intervals throughout the year<br />\n\tB) as quickly as possible<br />\n\tC) occasionally when necessary<br />\n\tD) regularly every winter</p>\n<p>\n\t30 .

The bell rang again , and then she heard her letter-box being pushed open . With the kettle of boiling water in her hand , she moved quietly towards the front door . A long piece of wire appeared through the letter-box , and then a hand . The wire turned and caught around the knob on the door-lock Mrs.Clark raised the kettle and poured the water over the hand . These was a shout outside , and the skin seemed to drop off the fingers like a glove .

It covers 24.4 thousand acres , and is twice the size of Manhattan .It was opened on October 1 , 1971 , five years later Walt Disney&rsquo;s death , and it is a larger , slightly more ambitious version of Disneyland near Los Angeles . Foreigners tend to associate Walt Disney with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , and with his other famous cartoon characters , Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck and Pluto , or with his nature films , whose superb photography is spoiled , in the opinion of some , by the vulgarity of the commentary and musical background .</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is very little that could be called vulgar in Disney World . It attracts people of most taste and most income groups , and people of all ages , from toddlers to grandpas . There are two expensive hotels , a golf course , and forest trails for horseback riding and rivers for canoeing . But the central attraction of the resort is the Magic Kingdom .</p>\n<p>\n\tBetween the huge parking lots and the Magic Kingdom lies a broad artificial lake .

Even getting to the Magic Kingdom&rsquo;s is quite and adventure . You have a choice of transportation . You can either cross the lake on a replica of a Mississippi paddle-wheeler , or you can glide around the shore in a streamlined monorail train .</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you reach the terminal , you walk straight into a little square which faces Main Street is late 19th century . There are modern shops inside the buildings ,but all the decades are of the period . There are hanging baskets full of red and white flowers , and there is no traffic except a horse-draw streetcar and an ancient double-decider bus . Yet as you walk through the magic Kingdom , you are actually walking on top of a network of underground roads . This is how the shops , restaurants and all the other material needs of the Magic Kingdom are invisibly supplied .</p>\n<p>\n\t36. In which year did Walt Disney die ?<br />\n\tA)1971 B)1976 C)1966 D)1900</p>\n<p>\n\t37.

  "description": "<p>\n\t<strong>Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)</strong><br />\n\tDirections: There are four passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:<br />\n\tThere are two methods of fighting, the one by law, the other by force; the first　method is that of men, the second of beasts; but as the first method is often　insufficient, one must have recourse to the second. It is, therefore, necessary　for a prince to know well how to use both the beast and the man. This was covertly taught to rulers by ancient writers, who related how Achilles and many others　of those ancient princes were given to Chiron the centaur to be brought up and educated under his discipline. The parable of this semi animal, semi human teacher is meant to indicate that a prince must know how to use both natures, and that the one without the other is not durable. A prince, being thus obliged to know well how to act as a beast, must imitate the fox, and the lion, for the lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox annot defend himself from wolves. Those that wish to be only lions do not understand this. Therefore, a prudent ruler ought not to keep faith when by doing so　it would be against his interest, and when the reasons which made him bind himself no longer exist. If men were all good, this precept would not be good ; but　as they are bad, and would not observe their faith with you, so you are not bound to keep faith with them. Nor have legitimate grounds ever failed a prince who　wished to show colorable excuse for the nonfulfilment of his promise. Of this one could furnish an infinite number of examples, and show how many times peace has been broken, and how many promises rendered worthless, by the faithlessness of princes, and those that have best been able to imitate the fox have succeeded best. But it is necessary to be able to disguise this character well, and to be a great feigner and dissembler, and men are so simple and so ready to obey present necessities, that the one who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.</p>\n<p>\n\t21.The author of the passage does not believe that ____.<br />\n\tA) people can protect themselves<br />\n\tB) the truth makes men free<br />\n\tC) leaders have to be consistent<br />\n\tD) princes are human</p>\n<p>\n\t22.The lion represents those who are ____.<br />\n\tA) too trusting B) strong and careful<br />\n\tC) reliant on force D) lacking in intelligence</p>\n<p>\n\t23.The fox, in this passage, is ____.<br />\n\tA) admired for his trickery B) no match for the lion<br />\n\tC) pitied for his trick D) considered worthless</p>\n<p>\n\t24.The writer suggests that a successful leader must ____.<br />\n\tA) be prudent and faithful<br />\n\tB) cheat and lie<br />\n\tC) have principle to guide his actions<br />\n\tD) tell the people the truth about his opponent</p>\n<p>\n\t25.The writer would approve an unsuccessful political candidate ____.<br />\n\tA) gave up all his opportunities<br />\n\tB) promised to try again next time<br />\n\tC) overthrew the government by force<br />\n\tD) told the people the truth about his opponent</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:<br />\n\tThe forest from which Man takes his timber is the tallest and most impressive plant community on Earth. In terms of Man's brief life it appears permanent and unchanging, save for the seasonal growth and fall of the leaves, but to forester it represents the climax of a long succession of events. No wooded landscape we see today has been forest for all time. Plants have minimum requirements of temperature and moisture and, in ages past, virtually every part of Earth's surface has at some time been either too dry or too cold for plants to survive. However, as soon as climatic conditions change in favour of plant life, a fascinating sequence of changes occurs, called a primary succession.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst to colonize the barren land are the lowly lichens, surviving on bare rock.</p>\n<p>\n\tSlowly, the acids produced by these organisms crack the rock surface, plant debris accumulates, and mosses establish a shallow root?hold. Ferns may follow and, with short grasses and shrubs, gradually form a covering of plant life. Roots probe even deeper into the developing soil and eventually large shrubs give way to the first trees. These grow rapidly, cutting off sunlight from the smaller plants, and soon establish complete domination&mdash;closing their ranks and forming a climax community which may endure for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet even this community is not everlasting. Fire may destroy it outright and settlers may cut it down to gain land for pasture or cultivation.

As she once said of herself: &ldquo;I would never sit back in a rocking chair, waiting for someone to help me.&rdquo; No one could have had a more productive age.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe was born Anna Mary Robertson on a farm in New York State, one of five boys and five girls.(&ldquo;We came in bunches, like radishes.&rdquo;) At twelve she left home and was in domestic service until, at twenty seven, she married Thomas Moses, the hired hand of one of her employers. They farmed most of their lives, first in Virginia and then in New York State, at Eagle Bridge. She had ten children, of whom five survived; her husband died in 1927. Grandma Moses painted a little as a child and made embroidery pictures as a hobby, but only switched to oils in old age because her hands had become too stiff to sew and she wanted to keep busy and pass the time. Her pictures were first sold at the local drugstore and at a fair, and were soon spotted by a dealer who bought everything she painted. Three of the pictures were exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, and in 1940 she had her first exhibition in New York. Between the 1930's and her death she produced some 2,000 pictures: detailed and lively portrayals of the rural life she had known for so long, with a marvelous sense of color and form. &ldquo;I think really hard till I think of something really pretty, and then I paint it.&rdquo;she said.</p>\n<p>\n\t1.Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?<br />\n\tA) Grandma Moses: A Biographical Sketch<br />\n\tB) The Children of Grandma Moses<br />\n\tC) Grandma Moses: Her Best Exhibition<br />\n\tD) Grandma Moses and Other Older Artists</p>\n<p>\n\t32.According to the passage, Grandma Moses began to paint because she wanted to ____.<br />\n\tA) decorate her home<br />\n\tB) keep active<br />\n\tC) improve her salary<br />\n\tD) gain an international reputation</p>\n<p>\n\t33.From Grandma Moses' description of herself in the first paragraph, it can be inferred that she was ____.<br />\n\tA) independent B) pretty<br />\n\tC) wealthy D) timid</p>\n<p>\n\t34.Grandma Moses spent most of her life ____.<br />\n\tA) nursing B) painting<br />\n\tC) embroidering D) farming</p>\n<p>\n\t35.In line 14, the word &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; could best be replaced by ____.<br />\n\tA) speckled B) featured<br />\n\tC) noticed D) damaged</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">\n\t<strong>参考答案见下页~</strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 25.2px;\">\n\t<strong>备考推荐：<a href=\"http://class.hujiang.com/17355373/intro?ch_source=ipo_en_0_rw&amp;editorid=842bc6fd\" target=\"_blank\">六级强化冲刺班</a></strong></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1162740/page2/\">点击查看第二页</a><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1162740/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1162740\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1166994/\">中国人的包子，被这个法国女人做成了艺术</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1149790/\">如何在火车上和老外搭讪？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1166549/\">你为什么工作效率低？因为上班时间太长了！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1159120/\">看完《花儿与少年》，我迷上了一个人练口语</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1160127/\">Quora精选：最奇葩的旷课理由</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1165607/\">双语美文：爱，是欣然接受你的笨拙</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p773883/\">有声双语美文：改变你生命的四个问题</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1166497/\">为了防止学生作弊，居然关闭了全国的互联网</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1166048/\">科学家说：这8个基因变异真的能给你超能力!</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1155932/\">20个基本的美国俚语（二）</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

First, your friends may not have too much money at hand, he or she maybe suffer from the lack of cash flow at that moment.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tEveryone has their own worries, when you borrow money, they always have to struggle for a while, their hesitations make you begin to doubt your friendship is true or whether your friends treat your as real one. Second, most people can't return the money in time, because they have all kinds of difficulties, this will make your friends in a awkward situation.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThey are considering whether to ask you return the money, if they do, this will make you embarrassed; If they don't, they will lack of money.

Different people have different opinions. Some believe that happiness is that they have much money so that they can live a better life. However, others regard happiness as having a good job or making a progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tActually, happiness is a true feeling from our inner heart!</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can consider carefully what our feeling is when we are in the following situations.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, we help an elderly across the road, or give some solutions to our classmates&rsquo; learning problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, we get some help from others when we are in need.</p>\n<p>\n\tThird, we make new friends, or have a meal with families, or have a conversation with parents and so on.</p>\n<p>\n\tEveryone would appreciate the people who give us a hand. What&rsquo;s more, we are glad when we stay with friends and families. All of these stand for we are happy.</p>\n<p>\n\tHappiness is just simple like these!</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>参考范文2</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with the improvement of living standards, people are no longer content with being fed and clothed adequately. They are more concerned about how to enhance their sense of happiness.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo a large extent, happiness depends on individuals&rsquo; understanding about it. For some people, happiness relies on material basis, without which they can't live comfortably and decently. For others, they believe that happiness has nothing to do with money. Thus to enhance happiness is not equal to improving one&rsquo;s material living standards. Instead, people are supposed to confront their life with right attitude, to be active and grateful in order to have a happy life.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor my part, money does buy happiness, but only up to the point where it enables one to live comfortably. To boost one&rsquo;s happiness not only needs the material but also the spiritual enrichment.

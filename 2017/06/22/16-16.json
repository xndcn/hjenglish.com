Views on the topic vary greatly among people from different walks of life. Some believe that it is a better choice to go to vocational school, but others consider it better to go to a university.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tI totally disagree with the first idea for the reasons presented below. To begin with, it harms the society in that vocational schools often equip students with some skills for jobs and send them to the society way too early. There will be great competition in the job market. The greater the competition is, the higher the unemployment rate, and consequently the more unstable the society will become. Furthermore, it is harmful to the students themselves. Without the choice to pursue higher level of learning, many great scholars today would never have achieved such great success.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tFrom my perspective, it is crucial that the government should encourage people to pursue higher and further study. Also it is high time that people understood the meaning and value of higher education. Only in this way can we achieve greater success.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n\t<span style=\"color: #006400;\"><strong>（沪江网校版）</strong></span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t<span style=\"color: #006400;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>3 翻译（唐朝）</strong></span></span></div>\n<div>\n\t唐朝始于618年，终于907年，是中国历史上最灿烂的时期。经过三百年的发展，唐代中国成为世界上最繁荣的强国，其首都长安是世界上最大的都市。这一时期，经济发达，商业繁荣，社会秩序稳定，甚至边境也对外开放。随着城市化的财富的增加，艺术和文学也繁荣起来。李白和杜甫是以作品简洁自然而著称的诗人。他们的诗歌打动了学者和普通人的心，即使在今天，他们的许多诗歌仍广为儿童及成人阅读背诵。</div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>基础版：</strong></div>\n<div>\n\tThe Tang Dynasty started in 618 and ended in 907.

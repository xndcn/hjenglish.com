The author concludes the passage by pointing out that____.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t[A] the present gun-licensing laws are held responsible for most of the crimes</p>\n<p>\n\t[B] educational failure accounts for most of the present offences</p>\n<p>\n\t[C] more help should be provided for released criminals</p>\n<p>\n\t[D] the long-term reduction of crime rate depends on multiple improvements</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>参考答案：</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t1.[A]意为：导致刑法的制定。第一段最后一句指出，(法律)惩罚是基于这样一种认识：许多人几乎无法控制自己的欲望，总想以不容许的方式行事。这里的含义是：为了制止人们这种想法和行为，制定法律来约束他们是必要的。</p>\n<p>\n\t2.[A] 第二段第四、五句指出，但是美国监狱在改造罪犯方面不成功。每年被逮捕的人中有约2/3的人有前科。</p>\n<p>\n\t3.[D] 第三段第一句指出，如果专家们能为不同的罪犯提供合适的改造方案，会大大地改进对罪犯的改造。注意：本句是一个虚拟句，表达作者的建议，它同时也是本段的主题句。</p>\n<p>\n\t4.[D] 第四段提到，自20世纪70年代末以来，人们更重视惩罚而不是改造，死刑的适用更加频繁，但是，阻止犯罪应该首先防止人们成为罪犯。这句话(第四句)表达了作者的观点。</p>\n<p>\n\t5.[D] 最后一段提到，人们自身也应该加强防范犯罪的意识，政府部门、法律部门也应该做出努力。可见，减少犯罪是一个综合治理问题。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1209529/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1209529\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1207801/\">如何一个人练口语？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1209019/\">11种孤独，你尝过几种？ | 好书推荐</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1207569/\">双语美文：真正的爱，远比一直合同强大</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1207205/\">Quora精选：这辈子让你思考最多的一句话</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1192024/\">有声双语美文：不是所有的争吵都是坏事</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1207368/\">飞机的窗户和座位，原来藏着这种心机</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1208135/\">Wi-Fi到底该怎么读？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1208133/\">TVB剧中，律师为什么都要戴假发？ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1193973/\">有声双语美文：在手机上聊天，细节很重要</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1208742/\">被喷子气到吐血？你可以试试这么做</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

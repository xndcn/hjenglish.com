I hope you will like it .<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; First I want to ask you some questions:<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1、Do you know what is youth?<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2、How do you master your youth?<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone has his own understanding of young. In Wikipedia,youth is the time of life when one is young, but often means the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity). It is also defined as &quot;the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young&quot;. Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work or having sexual relations without consent.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, Youth is not only a certain time of your life; also it is the shape of your mind. It is not only bright eyes, sweet smiles, nice voices, supple bodies, but also it is the way that you think and act.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth is a lively topic, youth is a mature turning.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth is like a gust of wind blowing, leaving only the dusty back.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been or are embrace the youth, we will lose our youth.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people say that youth is a scrap of paper, of no use. Every attempt nothing and accomplish nothing, only know to eat, drink, play, music, do not know how to study hard, do not know how parents bitterness, do not understand the meaning of life.Also some people, although they are unknown to the public, but they cherish their youth, cherish their own every second.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a new era of college students, should cherish the youth, to seize every minute to learn. We must hold to our youth, do not waste one's life. On the road of growing up, do every thing, each reading a good book, learn every bit of knowledge. We should not idle about all day, abandoned their studies. We want to make sure that the goal of life for themselves, to pursue the ideal of life. This is the youth: full power, full of expectations, voluntary, full of knowledge and the struggle of ambition.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth is a song, sing the life the most memorable fragment; youth is a painting, draw the outline of the most wonderful scene; youth is a poem, to praise the most beautiful moment in life; youth is the only way which must be passed to each of us in our life, it plays a significant role.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope my short speech will make you see the things clearly.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1015113/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1015113\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1009856/\">Quora精选：高效人士有哪些好的日常行为？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013758/\">心理学家告诉你：四招识破一个说谎的人！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013754/\">4招让你更聪明地学习</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p997576/\">2017最值得一读的新书 中国作家的也入选了！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013744/\">提升英语水平的5大建议</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p805845/\">2017新版《射雕英雄传》居然有8分！咋做到的</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p835048/\">有声双语美文：没有任何一个行为不带后果</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p996308/\">霉霉肯豆小李子，快来围观宇宙三大后宫团</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1001668/\">这专门收集亚洲萌娃的账号把老外都萌翻了</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1011120/\">Quora精选：你有没有毫无用处的超能力？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

She is not too tall, about 150cm.Her English name is Amy. She is experienced of English teaching. She teaches me for three years.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;She is special. Said she give us first on the first lesson, she gave us the first class and is not the same as other teachers. She says the first few minutes of discipline, and then, gave some learn the words and sentence patterns of fifth grade we review it again, let's learn the new knowledge would not be so unfamiliar, not like other teachers, the first class is a class discipline.She always shows English songs to us before her class. A few days later, she will ask us to follow the singing on the tape. I can still remember some songs she taught us. It is strange that she looks so weak, but no one in my class will against her word. I think maybe is because her own personality.Everyone respects her. She is serious in work, so that our whole class&rsquo;s English is good. Happily, she is our friend after class. She always plays badminton &nbsp;with us. She is also ready to help us if we have any difficulity. In my mind, a good teacher is more than a million books.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;After few weeks,she said she taught us to recite words. She said, remembering words actually isn't difficult at all, as long as you are willing to remember. I still clearly remember she taught us one way: a word. On the first day you come to see it, and then take a look at the third day, a week, and then a month and have a look at the last three months and look at it, you will never forget the word, Sue the teacher taught us to home reading, are the teacher told us to read before 15 ~ 30 minutes, and Sue the teacher told us to read only five minutes. She said, reading too long throat is uncomfortable, read 5 minutes a day is enough, I tried it back, throat really much more comfortable than before, and five minutes to read also remember more firmly than ever.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;This is our English teacher, is a special teacher,I would say thank you in my heart because you teach me a lot.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;My teacher, I love you.</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022187/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022187\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012403/\">双语美文：林肯的10句经典名言</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1001742/\">双语美文：你真的了解痛苦吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1022068/\">特朗普就职演说已出！完整视频+双语字幕</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013830/\">囧研究：情商高不一定好 这些坏处你都想不到</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012535/\">双语美文：你尽力了，但仍然会出问题</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019530/\">国产修图app火了：老外表示我好美！爱死了！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p990821/\">7个学习技巧，好成绩不再难</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019435/\">全世界最贵的房子 价值2.5亿美元的豪宅长啥样</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p986483/\">天天练口语，让你想说就说！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012395/\">双语美文：米歇尔&bull;奥巴马的8句经典名言</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

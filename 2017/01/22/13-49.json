Once I was in third grade, he treated me friendly and sincerely. When I was happy, he was also happy with me. When I was sad, he always comforted me. When I was defeated, he always encouraged me. When I stumbled, he always pulled me up. Although we quarreled at times, we were still in good relationships. We could know each other better after the argument. When my birthday came, he always sent me a special present.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; He's very hard-working and intelligent. He always studied hard at school. Because of his hard work, he always did very well in exams. His oral English was better than mine. Most of the time, he was willing to chat with me in English. Owing to his help, I made a lot of progress in oral English.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Do you know his hobby? Let me tell you! His favourite sport is badminton. He enjoys doing housework and playing computer games. So her mother loves him very much. And all of his family love him， too.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Lily,s a girl.And she is pretty.She is very good at English! And her English grades are very well!</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; I have known her since Grade SIX. We are both interested in English. Once both of us entered for an English contest. How eagerly I expected to get a prize! On hearing that I had failed in the contest, I could hardly hold back my tears. &quot;What a pity!&quot; I murmured to myself over and over again. I felt that the world had become cold and everyone seemed to be laughing at me.I love English and have gone all out to study it since my first day in the junior middle school. I have even dreamed of entering a foreign language institute. So I felt very sad.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp;　Just at this time, I received a short letter in English, saying, &quot;Failure is the mother of success. Cheer up! Don't lose confidence. Keep on your study and you will succeed!&quot; I knew it was from the good friend of mine.These words encouraged me greatly. I forgot all my sadness. From then on, I studied English even harder. In the next English contest, I got the first prize. Of course, she was delighted with my success.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; She always says， &quot;A life without a friend is a life without sunshine。&quot; My friend has done the same as he says.I'm happy to have such a friend.If she is in trouble， I'll try my best to help her.</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022175/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022175\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012403/\">双语美文：林肯的10句经典名言</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1001742/\">双语美文：你真的了解痛苦吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019530/\">国产修图app火了：老外表示我好美！爱死了！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012535/\">双语美文：你尽力了，但仍然会出问题</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1022068/\">特朗普就职演说已出！完整视频+双语字幕</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013830/\">囧研究：情商高不一定好 这些坏处你都想不到</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p990821/\">7个学习技巧，好成绩不再难</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012395/\">双语美文：米歇尔&bull;奥巴马的8句经典名言</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019435/\">全世界最贵的房子 价值2.5亿美元的豪宅长啥样</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p986483/\">天天练口语，让你想说就说！</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

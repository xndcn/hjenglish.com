Now,I will tell you something interesting about my school life.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;My school life is busy! I have four classes in the morning and three classes in the afternoon each day from Monday to Friday and forty minutes each..Classes begin at 8:10 a.m. We have to get to school before 7:30 because we have a morning class.I usually have lunch at school, then, I have a rest. After school, I often climb hills with my classmates on the playground. It,&rsquo;s my favorite outdoor activities I like it very much! What do you think?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;The courses I learn in school are Chinese, mathematics, English, geography, sports and so on. My favorite subject is math, because it &rsquo;s easy and interesting! Do you like math，can you tell me?I like English too because it&rsquo;s very interesting .Our English teacher is Miss Li. He speaks English well. He is very kind to us. My classmates love him very much. We like to play football with him after class. We read English every morning. We say &quot;Hello!&quot; and &quot;See you later!&quot; to all the teachers in our school in English. Other teachers say &quot;Good morning.&quot; and &quot;Sit down, please.&quot; to us in English, too. We are all glad to hear that.&nbsp;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;Apart from the classes, there are many activities in the school. I am active in my school life.After class I often play ball games with my classmates and they are all friendly to me. I also like swimming and drawing . These activities enrich my life. I made many new friends with the same hobbies, we are getting along well and helping each other to improve.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;In the sixth year of my primary school, I joined in a volunteer club. The mission of club is to help those people in need. The first activity I participated was to hold the charity sale to collect the money and donation, then bring them to a primary school into deep mountains. The sales was successful as most of the students supported this charity and donated the money and study materials with kindness. On the weekend we brought all the donations to the primary school, we saw the smile on children&rsquo; face, and also saw their poor study condition. I felt myself a heavy responsibility to make the change of it. Since then, I would volunteer to be an English teacher in that school every summer vacation, I also encouraged my friends to do something for those children.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;My school life is wonderful,isn't it?</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022169/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022169\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012403/\">双语美文：林肯的10句经典名言</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1001742/\">双语美文：你真的了解痛苦吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019530/\">国产修图app火了：老外表示我好美！爱死了！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012535/\">双语美文：你尽力了，但仍然会出问题</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1022068/\">特朗普就职演说已出！完整视频+双语字幕</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013830/\">囧研究：情商高不一定好 这些坏处你都想不到</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p990821/\">7个学习技巧，好成绩不再难</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012395/\">双语美文：米歇尔&bull;奥巴马的8句经典名言</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019435/\">全世界最贵的房子 价值2.5亿美元的豪宅长啥样</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p986483/\">天天练口语，让你想说就说！</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

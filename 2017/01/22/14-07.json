  "description": "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a student, we have study for many years. During these years, we study Chinese, English, science and so on.With the improvement of our knowledge, we not only read the books in class but also read extracurricular after school. Reading books not only broadens our horizon, but also enriches our minds.&nbsp;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I like reading，so I love many different kinds of books very much，because they not only broaden my horizons but also give me inspiration.Some books are to be overlooked, others are to be tasted, and some few to be chewed, digested all life long. So far, I have read numerous books, such as magazines, novels, story books and so on.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; But one of the books that I like best is My Life Story． It was created in 1902 by an American writer&mdash;Helen Keller, a blind, deaf and dumb person. In the book, she wrote that she had not been able to see, hear or speak since the age of one year and seven months, which made her desperately sad. When she was seven years old, she knew Miss Sullivan, her private tutor. Helen was getting happier every day. Then, Miss Sullivan helped her learn how to write English words. At first, Miss Sullivan wrote some words on Helen's hands with her own fingers again and again. Helen tried as much as possible to remember words and her efforts paid off. After that, she wrote and published many famous works, among which is My Life Story. My Life Story described her hard struggle to become an outstanding writer and educationist across the world.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; It shows us a universal truth：&ldquo;Nothing is difficult if you put your heart into it!&rdquo;This is why I like it best.What about you?</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; We always have dreams. What&rsquo;s ours dream? Do you know what you exactly want? And do you work hard for it.In my opinion Dream of the red chamber is the best book I have read. In this book, the great author Cao xueqin his view about love. He had firmly faith in what is the true love and try to tell us that there are different kinds of love, only one kind which should be considered as True Love.In this book, you can taste the feeling of the author about his strong will. In his words, you can find the charm of Chinese. It is not a book, but a precious deposits. You can get a lot from it. But unfortunately, the novel was never &quot;completed&quot; to such a state. On the other hand, maybe, it is another kind of beauty of the book. If you have not read this book yet, just go and read it. You will love it.</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022180/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1022180\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012403/\">双语美文：林肯的10句经典名言</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1001742/\">双语美文：你真的了解痛苦吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1022068/\">特朗普就职演说已出！完整视频+双语字幕</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013830/\">囧研究：情商高不一定好 这些坏处你都想不到</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012535/\">双语美文：你尽力了，但仍然会出问题</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019530/\">国产修图app火了：老外表示我好美！爱死了！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p990821/\">7个学习技巧，好成绩不再难</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1019435/\">全世界最贵的房子 价值2.5亿美元的豪宅长啥样</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p986483/\">天天练口语，让你想说就说！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1012395/\">双语美文：米歇尔&bull;奥巴马的8句经典名言</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

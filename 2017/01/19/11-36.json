  "description": "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Some people often say that gold and silver are the most valuable things the world.However,I have my reservations.In my submission,reading is more valuable than anything else.It&rsquo;s well known that book is the quintessence of human wisdom.Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes our daily life can start to feel dull, dry or depressing &mdash; I know it, you know it, we all know it. At times like this, I like to dive into a good fiction book for a much-needed escape into another world, where I can forget about whatever problems are stressing me out. Whether you want to travel to the land of the Hobbits, a galaxy far away or a tropical destination in a steamy romance novel is up to you. You&rsquo;ll come back refreshed after your mini-vacation to a fresh and exciting place in the world of words.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Books are our friends. They introduce us different kinds of knowledge. They lead us down the road to success.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Books are our teachers. They teach us troth, science, literature, and philosophy of life. Besides, they increase our knowledge, enlarge our experience,strengthen our character and do many other things which we can not do without them.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Books tell us what is good and what is evil. And only books can tell the good from the bad.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore to read more books is the best policy for our young students.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Reading introduced me to concepts like mindful eating, relaxation exercises, and the importance of loving yourself. If I didn&rsquo;t read, I wouldn&rsquo;t even be aware of these ideas, which have defined my entire coaching philosophy. If you don&rsquo;t read, you could be missing out on intriguing ideas that would likewise re-define your personal purpose or business philosophy.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; As is well known, books teach us to learn life, truth, science and many other useful things. They increase our knowledge, broaden our minds and strengthen our character. In other words, they are our good teachers and wise friends. This is the reason why our parents always encourage us to read more books.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\tReading is a good thing, but we must pay great attention to the choice of books. It is true that we can derive benefits from good books. However, bad books will do us more harm than good.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; However, in current days,many of us spend most of the leisure time in playing games or surfing the internet,instead of reading. it's a pity to find it less and less our students are interesting in reading,or have formed a habit of reading.So,in order to revive reading,this beneficial activity,we'd better take action right now.let's read together,learn together and grow !</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; One is never too old to learn.No matter at what time we realize the importance of reading,we can enjoy it during the rest of our life and finally we will see that it is rewarding to do so.&nbsp;</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1018178/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1018178\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016538/\">Quora精选：有些事人们总是太晚才明白</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p963872/\">智商不足怎么破？神经科学家说有一个好方法！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015291/\">10大热播剧集，你都看过吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016517/\">奥巴马离任倒计时：最后1次访谈 搬家准备让贤</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015262/\">双语美文：咖啡厅里的故事</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p986483/\">天天练口语，让你想说就说！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016479/\">春运这场最壮观的人口迁徙老外今年又来围观了</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013857/\">双语美文：先洗干净你自己的杯子</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015168/\">老外评选史上经典荧幕之吻TOP20：有甜也有虐</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015147/\">美国民众：川普你快关了推特吧！别出来丢人了</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

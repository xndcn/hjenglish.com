We may get a lot or lose so much in our life journey, but keeping a positive attitude should always be together with us. Nothing can defeat us if we are confident and diligent. Just as saying goes, God is equal to everyone. As he closes the door, he will also open a window for us.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; Many of us have seen a picture on the Internet of a man with a nice smile is struggling along with the aid of a stick because of losing one of his feet,and another man is sitting on the ground without shoes on his feet,looking anxious and depressed.How different the expressions flitting across their faces are!At the bottom of the drawing says&rdquo;Because I have no shoes,I keep complaining until I find another man who has lost one of his feet.&rdquo;</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; What an impressive drawing it is in revealing different attitudes toward life!A person's attitude towards life is very important, it determines your life, which path you are taking and how your life will become. if you are a person with very strong positive outlook, no matter what difficulties you encounter, you will always look at the bright side of life and never give up easily. &nbsp;Take Thomas Edison as an example.Before inventing the electric bulb,he had tried thousands of materials for lamp filament,but failed.Despite others&rsquo; laughing at him.he said,&rdquo;I am not a failure,at least I have proved these materials are not fit for filament.&rdquo;Before long he invented electric bulb.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; The most frequent example you see are those patients or people that are handicapped or suffering from some type of illness like cancer. They do not give up any glimpse of hope and continue fighting till they their last breathe. Even those very determined handicapped,they do not blame the world for their disable. Instead, they are contented and blessed with all the rest the have, their family , friends and those who support them greatly. Those handicapped with negative attitude towards life will feel that the world is unfair and they life in misery and always feel that they are unless and unwanted.</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; All in all,it is our attitudes that have changed everything in our life and help us to pull through all hardships.So we should strive to develop a positive attitude toward life and the world.It is convinced that only when we are equipped with optimism and confidence can we achieve success in the future.</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1018179/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1018179\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016538/\">Quora精选：有些事人们总是太晚才明白</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p963872/\">智商不足怎么破？神经科学家说有一个好方法！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015291/\">10大热播剧集，你都看过吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016517/\">奥巴马离任倒计时：最后1次访谈 搬家准备让贤</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015262/\">双语美文：咖啡厅里的故事</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p986483/\">天天练口语，让你想说就说！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1013857/\">双语美文：先洗干净你自己的杯子</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016479/\">春运这场最壮观的人口迁徙老外今年又来围观了</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015168/\">老外评选史上经典荧幕之吻TOP20：有甜也有虐</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015147/\">美国民众：川普你快关了推特吧！别出来丢人了</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

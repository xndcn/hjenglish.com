Everybody was born with a heart for beauty.</span></p>\n<p>\n\tToday in China,with the rising of our living standard, people's requirement of beauty has been heightened accordingly. Some people spare no money or energy on beautiful clothes, fashionable hair styles,the decoration of their houses and even the improvement of their looks. But it seems to me,all these are more or less confined to the beauty in appearance,or rather,the outward beauty.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my opinion,we shouldn't only pay attention to beautiful appearance and neglect the beautification of the mind and what we are after should be the perfect unity of the outward beauty and the inner beauty. As we all know,so far as objects and animals are concerned,there is only beautiful appearance to be mentioned, but to us humanbeings, although the outward beauty really matters, the inner beauty is much more important. This was confirmed by a famous Russian writer in words much like this: &ldquo;A person is not lovely for being beautiful but beautiful for being lovely. &rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHere, I'd like to quote two typical instances and I'm sure, my dear friends,from them you'll find out what real beauty is.</p>\n<p>\n\tRecently I learned from the radio an unpleasant incident about a well known singer. She is very charming with a sweet beautiful voice and very famous for singing the song.&ldquo;Devotion of Love&rdquo;。 Not long ago,she was invited to Zhejiang Province to give performance. The moment she was to appear on the stage,she suddenly asked for more reward. Worse still,after her request was satisfied, she didn't begin to sing at once. Instead,she took her time to count all the money piece by piece. Thus she kept the audience waiting for half an hour. So when she at last showed up and started to sing &ldquo;Devotion of Love&rdquo;，a man rose up from his seat and shouted at her,&ldquo;You don't have any devotion of love. You are not qualified to sing this song ! &rdquo;Hearing this, the singer stopped singing and began to shout abuses with her finger pointed at the man. At this time the whole audience burst into an uproar.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow disappointed her keen listeners were when they learned this! It is the singer herself who spoiled her beautiful image in the eyes of others.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I'm coming to another true story. It's about a poor, ordinary looking old woman. She was a widow without any children, living barely from hand to mouth by picking odds and ends from rubbish heaps. However,she took in more than ten homeless orphans successively and managed to bring them up. Every day she labored from morning till night. In order to earn as much money as possible to raise the children and to keep them in school,she even went to a hospital regularly to sell her blood. She got so weak for the loss of blood that she sometimes fell in a faint on her way home.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen asked why she chose to burden herself with so many children,she smiled and simply answered,&ldquo;Oh,I love children and I like to have their company. &rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThough the old woman was poor materially, she was full of affection and rich in spirit. She was loved dearly by her children. She was also highly appreciated by the local government, and truly respected by people in her community.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe you can't help wondering, &ldquo;What makes that ordinary woman so extraordinary?&rdquo; It is nothing else but her inner beauty, her true devotion of love without any thought of rewarding. What a sharp contrast there is between the great woman and the selfish singer.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo,to answer the question &ldquo;What is real beauty?&rdquo;,I declare definitely,it is the beauty lying in one's heart of hearts and embodied in his actions and deeds,that is,the inner heauty!</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1018066/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1018066\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016538/\">Quora精选：有些事人们总是太晚才明白</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015262/\">双语美文：咖啡厅里的故事</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015291/\">10大热播剧集，你都看过吗？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p986483/\">天天练口语，让你想说就说！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p963872/\">智商不足怎么破？神经科学家说有一个好方法！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1015174/\">52个字母组成的单词当选年度词 你们认真的?!</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016629/\">侦探技能：从阅读中你能推论出什么</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1017911/\">为什么西方人觉得13这个数字不吉利？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1016517/\">奥巴马离任倒计时：最后1次访谈 搬家准备让贤</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1017868/\">奥巴马夫妇的恩爱抓拍 每一张都是大写的虐狗</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

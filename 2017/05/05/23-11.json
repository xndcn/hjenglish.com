There is nothing like seeing a loved one&rsquo;s smiling face looking down on you from a picture frame on your wall. It is both <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/comforting\" target=\"_blank\">comforting</a> and <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/reassuring\" target=\"_blank\">reassuring</a>, almost like they are watching over you while you work at your desk.我的思想多少有点守旧，总觉得那些手机里存着的照片少了些什么，不如将那些所爱之人的照片挂在墙上，再没有比看着他们的笑容，让人觉得舒服安心。就好像他们都在看着你工作一样。</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I work at my own desk I can see my Mom&rsquo;s picture smiling down on me. She left us too soon. She was only 55 years old when cancer took her. If one&rsquo;s years here were based on <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/merit\" target=\"_blank\">merit</a> then she should have lived to be over 100. 在我的工作桌上放着母亲的照片，工作时照片中的母亲对着我微笑。她走得太早，55岁那年因癌症去世，假使以一个人的美德来决定她的寿命的话，那她肯定能活到100岁。</p>\n<p>\n\tMy Dad&rsquo;s kind smile is next to hers. It has only been a few years since he passed. Sometimes I still pick up the telephone wanting to call him and tell him something that has just happened to me only to remember that he is gone.有着父亲慈祥笑容的照片就排在母亲照片的旁边，他去世没有几年。有时候，我拿起电话想要打给他，告诉他才发生的事情，才意识到他已经不再人世了。</p>\n<p>\n\tMy Nana&rsquo;s picture is there too, holding the 90 years young sign at her birthday party 16 years ago. How I wish I could walk into her kitchen again, have a talk, and share a big slice of homemade Italian bread with her.我奶奶的照片也在墙上，那张照片拍摄于16年前，是她90岁大寿聚会照片。我多想再走进她的厨房，和她聊聊天，一起分一块自制的意大利面包吃。</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes looking at these pictures gives me a touch of <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/melancholy\" target=\"_blank\">melancholy</a> and sadness. I still miss them all and I don&rsquo;t feel ready to be the oldest generation yet. Most of the time, though, I only feel the <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/warmth\" target=\"_blank\">warmth</a> and joy that comes from a million loving memories that these pictures bring back.有时候看着这些照片让我忧伤难过，我依然思念着他们，我还没有准备好成为家庭中最年老的一代。但是大部分的时间这些照片带给我的是无尽的爱的回忆，让我感到温暖美好。</p>\n<p>\n\tIt makes me feel blessed knowing that I had them all in my life for the years that I did. It makes me want to follow their loving example in my own life as well.他们在我生命中的出现让我感到幸福，他们是爱的楷模，让我再自己的生活中学习效仿。</p>\n<p>\n\tA lot of people say that you have to have a hard heart to get through life. Others say a soft heart is better. I myself think that a strong heart is best. We need a heart that loves through the pain. We need a heart that keeps loving even when we lose the people we love the most. 很多人都说度过一生需要一颗坚硬的心，另一些人认为内心要柔软才好。我觉得一颗坚强的心是最好的，我们在痛苦中需要爱，哪怕失去挚爱也继续把爱传承。</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need a heart that knows that &ldquo;Anyone who lives in love lives in God, and God lives in him.&rdquo; May your heart be strong then. May your love shine from your pictures and from your life.那些心存上帝者，上帝便与他同在。愿你拥有一颗坚强之心，愿你所爱之人，不光在照片中，还在你的生活中永存生辉。</p>\n<p>\n\t（翻译：林浔鸥）</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; color: #999999;\">\n\t声明：本双语文章的中文翻译系沪江英语原创内容，转载请注明出处。中文翻译仅代表译者个人观点，仅供参考。如有不妥之处，欢迎指正。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1141039/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1141039\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p736960/\">有声双语美文：爱要及时说出口</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143619/\">外媒评选：年轻人觉得最好看的12部美剧</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143682/\">学会交谈有多重要？| 父亲用2句话救了女儿</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143663/\">囧研究：直男们对女人化妆的看法</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143640/\">伊万卡写了本女权主义的书，结果被女人狂喷</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1135550/\">比董卿朗读《红楼梦》更美的，是英文版的语言魅力！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1134460/\">成语翻译：沧海一粟&草船借箭</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1121383/\">100年前的生活妙招：脚扭伤了，用冷水治疗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1144405/\">如果一夜暴富，该如何处理这些钱？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1138571/\">这15种商务表达最常用，你知道吗？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Whether you are deciding with friends where to eat lunch or convincing a boss you deserve a promotion, you can always benefit from knowing the secrets of persuasion.每个人一生中大部分时间都会有说服别人的经历。无论是和朋友决定午餐地点或说服老板该给你升职，知道说服的秘诀总能给你带来好处。</span></p>\n<p>\n\tIn Dr. Robert Cialdini's bestselling book &quot;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, &quot; what he found was :在Robert Cialdini博士的畅销书《影响：说服心理》（Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion）中，他发现：</p>\n<p>\n\tBehavior is heavily influenced by unconscious psychological factors无意识的心理因素对行为影响很大</p>\n<p>\n\tThese psychological factors can be identified and utilized这些心理因素可以被确认并加以利用</p>\n<p>\n\tIf used correctly, people have no idea that they are being manipulated如果使用得当，人们都不知道他们正在被控制</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"><a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/Reciprocity\" target=\"_blank\">Reciprocity</a></span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">相互作用</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"></span></p>\n<p>\n\tFree samples. Have you ever seen free samples being handed out in grocery stores or while walking down the street? Rest assured they aren't doing this out of the kindness of their hearts. Studies have shown a dramatic increase in efficacy of marketing tactics if they are preceded by a &quot;gift&quot; which triggers a natural feeling of debt in the target.免费样品。你在商店里或走在街上时是否见过有人发放免费样品？他们这样做肯定不是出于好心。研究已经表明如果卖东西之前先赠送一个小礼物的话，营销效果会有戏剧性的提高，因为这个小礼物会激起目标人群自然的欠债心理。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Consistency</strong><strong>一致性</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAn amazingly powerful concept. People will go to extraordinary lengths without even realizing it, just to remain consistent with their past actions and beliefs. This principle is especially significant if past behavior is public or written down, in which case it can't be denied.一个影响力惊人的概念。人们会下意识地竭尽全力，只是为了坚持以往的行为和信念。如果以往行为被公开或被记录下来的话就不可否认，那这个原则就会显得尤为重要。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Social Proof</strong><strong>社会证明</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWhy are there those silly laugh tracks on sit com TV shows? Because they work! People are extremely susceptible to the opinions of others, even when obviously false.为什么情景喜剧里会有那些傻笑的背景声音呢？因为它们很有效！人们非常容易受其他人想法影响，甚至在这些想法明显错误时也会如此。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Authority</strong><strong>权威</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn the aftermath of World War II and the atrocities committed by many seemingly normal Nazi commanders, greater attention was focused on the nature of authority in influencing people's behavior. It turns out, authority is one of the most powerful effects yet discovered.二战过后，在那些貌似正常的纳粹军官所犯的罪行中，权威影响人们行为的特性引起了人们更多的关注。结果证明权威是已知的最具影响力的事物之一。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Liking</strong><strong>喜欢</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWe all know that we are more likely to respond to a request from somebody we like than from somebody we dislike. But how much further does this feeling go? Apparently, a lot further!我们都知道相对于我们不喜欢的人提出的要求我们更有可能会对喜欢的人的要求作出回应，这两种感觉之间有多大差距呢？显然是天壤之别。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Scarcity</strong><strong>短缺</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the most fundamental attributes of persuasion, salespeople have been using the concept of scarcity for a very long time (ever hear or see the phrase &quot;limited time only&quot;)? This one is also of interest to the relatively new field of behavioral economics.这是说服力最基本的特质之一。销售人员很久以来一直利用这个概念（是否听过或看过&ldquo;时间有限&rdquo;这样的话？）这个理念对于行为经济学这一新兴领域来说也是很有趣的。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><br />\n\t获得462.4k好评的回答@Colin Gerber：<br />\n\t</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMemory consolidation and productivity can both be improved by taking breaks.记忆力的增强和工作能力均可以通过休息来提高。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Memory consolidation:</strong><strong>增强记忆力：</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tTambini et al. recently showed that resting your brain after learning is very important in memory consolidation. During rest the hippocampus is able to transfer information to the cortex to be stored. The brain cannot do this very effectively if you do not take breaks.Tambini et al.最近表明学习之后让大脑休息对于巩固记忆力非常重要。休息期间海马体能把信息转移到大脑皮层储存起来。如果不休息大脑就不能有效完成这个过程。</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"></span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Productivity</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"></span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">工作能力</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"></span></p>\n<p>\n\tIt is suggested that you work in 60-90 minute intervals and then take a break. Ericsson et al. conducted a very interesting study looking at elite and average violin players and how much they practiced. They found that the elite players practiced for about the same amount of time as the good players per day. However, the elite players would practice very hard for no more than 90 minutes and then take breaks and even naps in between while the average players would practice throughout the day but with less focus.建议你每工作60-90分钟就休息一会儿。Ericsson et al.进行了一个非常有趣的研究，他观察了优秀的和普通的小提琴演奏家以及他们练习的多少，发现优秀的演奏家和普通的演奏者每天练习的总时间是一样的，但优秀的演奏家勤奋练习的时间不超过90分钟，然后就会休息甚至睡一会再练，而普通的演奏者整天不间断练习，但注意力却不够集中。</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><br />\n\t获得24.3k好评的回答@Dean Yeong：<br />\n\t</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe world is so full of creeping dementia that forgetting feels <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/ominous\" target=\"_blank\">ominous</a>. If learning is building up skills and knowledge, then forgetting is losing some of what was gained. It seems like the enemy of learning.世界上有这么多反应慢的痴呆以至于遗忘让人感觉很不好。如果学习是在积累技巧和知识，那么遗忘就是丢掉已经得到的东西，它似乎是学习的敌人。</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's not. The truth is nearly the opposite.其实不然，事实上恰恰相反。</p>\n<p>\n\tOne upside of forgetting is that it is nature&rsquo;s most <a class=\"hjdict\" href=\"https://dict.hjenglish.com/w/sophisticated\" target=\"_blank\">sophisticated</a> spam filter. It's what allows the brain to focus, enabling sought-after facts to pop to mind.遗忘的一个好处就是它是自然中最复杂的过滤器，它能让大脑集中注意力，使大脑能想起最想找的信息。</p>\n<p>\n\tWe engage in this kind of focused forgetting all the time without giving it much thought. To lock in a new computer password, we must block the old one from coming to mind; to absorb a new language, we must hold off the corresponding words in our native tongue.我们一直在进行这种集中注意力的遗忘却不自知。为了记住新的电脑密码，我们必须忘掉旧的；为了学习新的语言，我们就不能去想母语里相同意思的词。</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the 19th century American psychologist William James observed：If we remembered everything, we should on most occasions be as ill off as we remembered nothing.正如19世纪美国心理学家William James所观察到的：如果我们记住一切，那么大多数情况下就会感觉自己好像什么都没记住。</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t（翻译：菲菲）</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; color: #999999;\">\n\t声明：本双语文章的中文翻译系沪江英语原创内容，转载请注明出处。中文翻译仅代表译者个人观点，仅供参考。如有不妥之处，欢迎指正。</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1141977/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1141977\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p736960/\">有声双语美文：爱要及时说出口</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143619/\">外媒评选：年轻人觉得最好看的12部美剧</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143682/\">学会交谈有多重要？| 父亲用2句话救了女儿</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143663/\">囧研究：直男们对女人化妆的看法</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143640/\">伊万卡写了本女权主义的书，结果被女人狂喷</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1135550/\">比董卿朗读《红楼梦》更美的，是英文版的语言魅力！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1134460/\">成语翻译：沧海一粟&草船借箭</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1121383/\">100年前的生活妙招：脚扭伤了，用冷水治疗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1144405/\">如果一夜暴富，该如何处理这些钱？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1138571/\">这15种商务表达最常用，你知道吗？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

I went to a bookstore nearby the university to buy an English dictionary. It was only after I paid for the dictionary and returned to school that I found some pages were missing. But when I went back to the bookstore to tell them about the matter, they said that I should have checked the dictionary before I left the store. According to them, it was my fault and they hold no responsibility for the whole matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I want to say is that sincerity and enthusiasm are vital to the survival of service industries in such a market economy featured by fierce competition. It was quite easy for them to change the dictionary for me but they refused to do so. They will lose all customers if they persist in doing so. I hope that this letter can draw the attention of the whole society and that the problem can be solved as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tBest regards.</p>\n<p>\n\tYours sincerely</p>\n<p>\n\tLi Ming</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">备考推荐：<a href=\"http://class.hujiang.com/17337017/intro?ch_source=ipo_en_0_rw&amp;editorid=842bc6fd\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;碾压&rdquo;四级 &nbsp;限时福利</a></strong></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1141917/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1141917\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p736960/\">有声双语美文：爱要及时说出口</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143619/\">外媒评选：年轻人觉得最好看的12部美剧</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143682/\">学会交谈有多重要？| 父亲用2句话救了女儿</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143663/\">囧研究：直男们对女人化妆的看法</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143640/\">伊万卡写了本女权主义的书，结果被女人狂喷</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1135550/\">比董卿朗读《红楼梦》更美的，是英文版的语言魅力！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1134460/\">成语翻译：沧海一粟&草船借箭</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1121383/\">100年前的生活妙招：脚扭伤了，用冷水治疗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1144405/\">如果一夜暴富，该如何处理这些钱？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1138571/\">这15种商务表达最常用，你知道吗？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

With cars, we can go anywhere anytime we want. However, for the sake of protecting our environment and of the public travelling convenience, it is a bad news.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tFirst, more private cars mean more pollution. As the number of private cars increases sharply, the off gas surges. Consequently, the air quality is decreasing and even affects our health. In consideration of our environment and our health, I don&rsquo;t think private cars bring us good to both our planet&rsquo;s environment and our health.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">Second, people are tending to drive cars themselves going to work so that the traffic jam is serious in most cities. Whenever you go and look around in cities, you can see lots of cars not only parking along the road but also runs on the street. Especially around morning and evening, you can hardly move a step if you drive a car because of the heavy traffic. No matter how many roads the government has built, without lessening the number of the private cars, the need for road is always bigger than the supplied. Therefore, the most effective way is to encourage people take public transportation so that we can facilitate ourselves and also others.</span></p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">All in all, private cars are so convenient for us to getting around. However, take our air environment, our health and the convenience of public life into account; we shouldn&rsquo;t encourage people to buy more private cars. Instead, we should persuade people to take public transportation as often as possible to make our environment better and better.</span></p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>参考例文二：</strong></p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tPrivate cars have become an important aspect of people&rsquo;s life in many parts of our country,especially in large cities such as Beijing,Shanghai and Guangzhou.While they bring much convenience to people,they are also widely criticized.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThere are some arguments for owning private cars.In the first place,cars allow people to move around freely,which greatly improves our living standard.We easily drive cars for traveling.In second place,When we have something urgent to do,cars are quick than other vehicles in some extent.Last but not least,the car industry can boost economy by creating many job opportunities.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHowever,there are also many arguments against cars.First of all,they pollute the environment by emitting harmful gases.What&rsquo;s more,cars cause a large number of traffic accidents,which bring great misery to their family.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs far as I am concerned,we should limit the number of private cars by providing better mass transportation and better service for the people.Everyone should sacrifice his or her own interest for the mass society.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>词汇：</strong></p>\n\t<p>\n\t\towners&nbsp;[ˈəʊnə]&nbsp;n.&nbsp;物主；主人&nbsp;</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tconvenience&nbsp;[kənˈviːnɪəns]&nbsp;n.&nbsp;方便；便利的事物，便利设施；（公共）厕所</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tconsequently&nbsp;adv.所以，因此</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tespecially&nbsp;特别；尤其；格外；主要</p>\n</div>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1137561/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1137561\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p736960/\">有声双语美文：爱要及时说出口</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143619/\">外媒评选：年轻人觉得最好看的12部美剧</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143682/\">学会交谈有多重要？| 父亲用2句话救了女儿</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143663/\">囧研究：直男们对女人化妆的看法</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1143640/\">伊万卡写了本女权主义的书，结果被女人狂喷</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1135550/\">比董卿朗读《红楼梦》更美的，是英文版的语言魅力！ </a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1134460/\">成语翻译：沧海一粟&草船借箭</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1121383/\">100年前的生活妙招：脚扭伤了，用冷水治疗</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1144405/\">如果一夜暴富，该如何处理这些钱？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1138571/\">这15种商务表达最常用，你知道吗？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

To mark the occasion, National Geographic News has compiled a list of some of the more memorable hoaxes in recent history. They are the lies, darned(可恨的) lies, and whoppers(弥天大谎)that have been perpetrated on the gullible(易受骗的)and unsuspecting to fulfill that age-old desire held by some to put the joke on others.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Internet Hoaxes</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The Internet has given birth to a proliferation(增殖)of hoaxes. E-mail inboxes are bombarded on an almost daily basis with messages warning of terrible computer viruses that cause users to delete benign(良性)chunks of data from their hard drives, or of credit card scams that entice the naive to give all their personal information, including passwords and bank account details, to identity thieves. Other e-mails give rise to wry(歪曲的)chuckles, which is where this list begins.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide(一氧化二氢)</p>\n<p>\n\t　　City officials in Aliso Viejo, California, were so concerned about the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide that they scheduled a vote last month on whether to ban foam(泡沫)cups from city-sponsored events after they learned the chemical was used in foam-cup production.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Officials called off the vote after learning that dihydrogen monoxide is the scientific term for water.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　&quot;It's embarrassing,&quot; city manager David J. Norman told the Associated Press. &quot;We had a paralegal(律师助手)who did bad research.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Indeed, the paralegal had fallen victim to an official-looking Web site touting the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide. An e-mail originally authored in 1990 by Eric Lechner, then a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, claimed that dihydrogen monoxide &quot;is used as an industrial solvent and coolant, and is used in the production of Styrofoam(聚苯乙烯泡沫塑料).&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Other dangers pranksters(爱开玩笑的人)associated with the chemical included accelerated corrosion and rusting, severe burns, and death from inhalation.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Versions of the e-mail continue to circulate today, and several Web sites, including that of the Coalition to Ban DHMO, warn, tongue-in-cheek, of water's dangers.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Alabama Changes Value of Pi</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The April 1998 newsletter put out by New Mexicans for science and Reason contains an article titled &quot;Alabama Legislature Lays Siege to Pi&quot;. It was penned by April Holiday of the Associmated Press (sic) and told the story of how the Alabama state legislature voted to change the value of the mathematical constant Pi from 3.14159 to the round number of 3.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The ersatz(假的)news story was written by Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist Mark Boslough to parody(滑稽地模仿)legislative and school board attacks on the teaching of evolution in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　At Boslough's suggestion, Dave Thomas, the president of New Mexicans for science and Reason, posted the article in its entirety to the Internet newsgroup Talk. Origins on April 1. (The newsgroup hosts a lively debate on creation vs. evolution.) Later that evening Thomas posted a full confession to the hoax. He thought he had put all rumors to bed.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　But to Thomas's surprise, however, several newsgroup readers forwarded the article to friends and posted it on other newsgroups.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　When Thomas checked in on the story a few weeks later, he was surprised to learn that it had spread like wildfire. The telltale signs of the article's satirical intent, such as the April 1 date and misspelled &quot;Associmated Press&quot; dateline, had been replaced or deleted.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Alabama legislators were bombarded with calls protesting the law. The legislators explained that the news was a hoax. There was not and never had been such a law.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　TV and Newspaper Hoaxes</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Before the advent of the Internet, and even today, traditional media outlets such as newspapers, radio, and television, have sometimes hoaxed their audiences. The deceptions run the gamut from purported natural disasters to wishful news.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Swiss Spaghetti (意大利式细面条) Harvest</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Alex Boese, curator of the Museum of Hoaxes, a regularly updated Web site that also appeared in book form in November 2002, said one of his favorite hoaxes remains one perpetrated by the British Broadcasting Company.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　On April 1, 1957, the BBC aired a report on the television news show Panorama about the bumper spaghetti harvest in southern Switzerland.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Viewers watched Swiss farmers pull pasta off spaghetti trees as the show's anchor, Richard Dimbleby, attributed the bountiful harvest to the mild winter and the disappearance of the spaghetti weevil.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The broadcaster detailed the ins and outs of the life of the spaghetti farmer and anticipated questions about how spaghetti grows on trees. Thousands of people believed the report and called the BBC to inquire about growing their own spaghetti trees, to which the BBC replied, &quot;Place a sprig of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　&quot;It was a great satirical effect about British society,&quot; Boese said. &quot;British society really was like that at that time. The British have a tendency to be a bit insulated(绝缘的) and do not know that much about the rest of Europe.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Taco Liberty Bell</p>\n<p>\n\t　　On April 1, 1996, readers in five major U.S. cities opened their newspapers to learn from a full page announcement that the Taco Bell Corporation had purchased the Liberty Bell from the U.S. government. The announcement reported that the company was relocating the historic bell from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Irvine, California. The move, the corporation said in the advertisement, was part of an &quot;effort to help the national debt&quot;.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Hundreds of other newspapers and television shows ran stories related to the press release on the matter put out by Taco Bell's public relations firm, PainePR. Outraged citizens called the Liberty Bell National Historic Park in Philadelphia to express their disgust. A few hours later the public relations firm released another press announcement stating that the stunt was a hoax.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　White House press secretary Mike McCurry got into the act when he remarked that the government would also be &quot;selling the Lincoln Memorial to Ford Motor Company and renaming it the Lincoln-Mercury Memorial&quot;.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Crop Circles</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Strange, circular formations began to appear in the fields of southern England in the mid-1970s, bringing busloads of curious onlookers, media representatives, and believers in the paranormal out to the countryside for a look.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　A sometimes vitriolic(讽刺的)debate on their origins has since ensued(跟着发生), and the curious formations have spread around the world, becoming more and more elaborate as the years go by.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Some people consider the crop formations to be the greatest works of modern art to emerge from the 20th century, while others are convinced they are signs of extraterrestrial communications or landing sites of UFOs.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The debate rages even today, although in 1991 Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two elderly men from Wiltshire County, came forward and claimed responsibility for the crop circles that appeared there over the preceding 20 years. The pair made the circles by pushing down nearly ripe crops with a wooden plank suspended from a rope.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Moon Landinga Hoax?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Ever since NASA sent astronauts to the moon between 1969 and 1972, skeptics have questioned whether the Apollo missions were real or simply a ploy to one-up(领先)the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The debate resurfaced and reached crescendo levels in February 2001, when For television aired a program called Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Guests on the show argued that NASA did not have the technology to land on the moon. Anxious to win the space race, NASA acted out the Apollo program in movie studios, they said. The conspiracy theorists pointed out that the pictures transmitted from the moon do not include stars and that the flag the Americans planted on the moon is waving, even though there is though to be no breeze on the moon.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　NASA quickly refuted these claims in a series of press releases, stating that any photographer would know it is difficult to capture something very bright and very dim on the same piece of film. Since the photographers wanted to capture the astronauts striding across the lunar surface in their sunlit space suits, the background stars were too faint to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　As for the flag, NASA said that the astronauts were turning it back and forth to get in firmly planted in the lunar soil, which made it wave.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　1. Some people have the age-old desire to put the joke on others.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　2. According to the passage, the only form of Internet hoaxes is e-mail hoax.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　3. Dihydrogen monoxide is a very dangerous chemical, which is often used as an industrial solvent.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　4. Dihydrogen monoxide can accelerate corrosion and rusting, and cause sever burns and even death from inhalation.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　5. The reason why the ersatz news that Alabama changed the value of Pi spread wildly was that ________ forwarded the article to friends and posted it on other newsgroups.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　6. Traditional media outlets such as ________ may still hoax their audiences nowadays.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　7. According to Boese, many people believed the report of Swiss spaghetti harvest because the British did not know ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　8. According to a hoax announcement, the Taco Bell Corporation bough the Liberty Bell and moved it to Irvine to help ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　9. The crop circles were thought to be the greatest works of modern art, the signs of ________ or landing sites of UFOs.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　10. Some people thought that NASA acted out the Apollo program in movie studios partially because the pictures transmitted from the moon do not include ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)</span></p>\n<p>\n\t　　Section A</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words on Answer Sheet 2.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Wild ducks and other migratory(迁移的) birds could be important carriers of deadly bird flu, researchers say. Even so, the infectious-disease experts say there is no solid basis for killing wild birds to protect poultry and minimize the risk of human infection.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The European team investigating the global spread of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza(禽流感)says certain duck species may be infecting wild bird populations. Geese and wading birds are also possible vectors(带菌者)of the virus, the team says.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The team's study was led by Bj&ouml;rn Olsen of Umea University in Sweden. Olsen runs Europe's largest wild-bird flu monitoring program.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Studies have shown that influenza viruses in lake water, generally passed via bird feces(粪), can stay infectious for up to 30 days. The migration or feeding behavior of dabbling ducks could at least partially explain the spread of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the researchers add.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　This group of duck species includes mallards, teal, pintails, and others that feed at or near the surface, where viruses in water are most likely to be picked up. Perhaps as a result, dabblers have the highest known rates of avian influenza infection, the study says. For instance, nearly 13 percent of mallards tested positive for bird flu. Other species tested include the American black duck (18.1 percent), blue-winged teal (11.5 percent), and northern pintail (11.2 percent).</p>\n<p>\n\t　　However, bird flu viruses appear to exist in ducks in a low-pathogenic form, meaning infection doesn't usually lead to severe illness and death.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　&quot;Dabbling ducks are for sure the prime hosts for low pathogenic viruses,&quot; said study co-author Ron Fouchier, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands. &quot;But the big question is, how much of our knowledge about these viruses can we translate to high-pathogenic viruses such as the H5N1 strain of bird flu?&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　In poultry avian viruses can mutate(变异)into more virulent influenza strains, including H5N1. If this mutated virus then finds its way back into wild populations, the birds could then spread the disease through migration.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Some scientists have argued that wild birds infected with HN51 would be too ill to migrate. Swans, for instance, appear to be particularly vulnerable to the strain. &quot;Swans apparently drop dead quite easily, but they are unlikely to be the vector because they are not going to fly very far if they are dead,&quot; Fouchier said.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　But the study team says that some birds that have been purposely infected for the sake of research show that wild birds can survive H5N1. &quot;For some reason H5N1 has adapted so it no longer kills dabbling ducks,&quot; Fouchier said. This means the ducks may be able to spread the virus over a wide area.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The study team says migratory geese may also be vectors, because they often graze in huge flocks, a practice that could encourage transmission.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Migrating ducks, the researchers add, &quot;could provide an intercontinental bridge&quot; for bird flu to North America, which has not yet had any known cases of H5N1.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　47. According to the author, what may be the possible carriers of bird flu?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　48. The main sources of influenza viruses in lake water are ________, which may stay infectious for up to 30 days.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　49. By saying &quot;bird flu viruses appear to exist in ducks in a low-pathogenic form&quot; (Para. 6), the author suggests that infection ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　50. On what condition can the birds spread the influenza through migration?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　51. According to the study team, ________ is a practice that can encourage transmission of the bird flu.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Section B</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Passage One</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　For about three centuries we have been doing science, trying science out, using science for the construction of what we call modern civilization. Every dispensable item of contemporary technology, from canal locks to dial telephones to penicillin, was pieced together from the analysis of data provided by one or another series of scientific experiments. Three hundred years seems a long time for testing a new approach to human inter-living, long enough to set back for critical appraisal of the scientific method, maybe even long enough to vote on whether to go on with it or not. There is an argument.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Voices have been raised in protest since the beginning, rising in pitch and violence in the nineteenth century during the early stages of the industrial revolution, summoning urgent crowds into the streets on the issue of nuclear energy. &quot;Give it back,&quot; say some of the voices, &quot;It doesn't really work, we've tried it and it doesn't work. Go back three hundred years and start again on something else less chancy for the race of man.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The principle discoveries in this century, taking all in all, are the glimpses of the depth of our ignorance of nature. Things that used to seem clear and rational, and matters of absolute certainty-Newtonian mechanics, for example-have slipped through our fingers; and we are left with a new set of gigantic puzzles, cosmic uncertainties, and ambiguities. Some of the laws of physics are amended every few years; some are canceled outright; some undergo revised versions of legislative intent as if they were acts of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Just thirty years ago we call it a biological revolution when the fantastic geometry of the DNA molecule was exposed to public view and the linear language of genetics was decoded. For a while, things seemed simple and clear: the cell was a neat little machine, a mechanical device ready for taking to pieces and reassembling, like a tiny watch. But just in the last few years it has become almost unbelievably complex, filled with strange parts whose functions are beyond today's imagining.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　It is not just that there is more to do, there is everything to do. What lies ahead, or what can lie ahead if the efforts in basic research are continued, is much more than the conquest of human disease or the improvement of agricultural technology or the cultivation of nutrients in the sea. As we learn more about fundamental processes of living things in general we will learn more about ourselves.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　52. What CANNOT be inferred from the first paragraph?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] Scientific experiments in the past three hundred years have produced many valuable items.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] For three hundred years there have been people holding a hostile attitude toward science.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] Modern civilization depends on science so man supports scientific progress unanimously.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] Some people think three hundred years is not long enough to set back for critical appraisal of scientific method.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　53. The principle discovery in this century shows ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] man has overthrown Newton's laws of physics</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] man has solved a new set of gigantic puzzles</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] man has lost many scientific discoveries</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] man has given up some of the once accepted theories</p>\n<p>\n\t　　54. Now scientists have found in the past few years ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] the exposure of DNA to the public is unnecessary</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] the tiny cell in DNA is a neat little machine</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] man knows nothing about DNA</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] man has much to learn about DNA</p>\n<p>\n\t　　55. The writer's main purpose in writing the passage is to say that ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] science is just at its beginning</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] science has greatly improved man's life</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] science has made profound progress</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] science has done too little to human beings</p>\n<p>\n\t　　56. The writer's attitude towards science is ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] critical [B] approving [C] neutral [D] regretful</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Passage Two</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Here amid the steel and concrete canyons, green grass grows. A hawthorn tree(山楂树) stands in new soil, and freshly dug plants bend in the wind.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　But Chicago City Hall here seems an unlikely spot for a garden of any varietyespecially 20,000 square feet of gardenson its roof.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　As one of a handful of similar projects around the country, the garden is part of a $1.5 million demonstration projected by the city to reduce its &quot;urban heat islands&quot;, said William Abolt, the commissioner of the Department of Environment.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Heat islands-dark surfaces in the city, like rooftops-soak up heat. The retention can bake a building, making it stubborn to cooling.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The roof of City Hall, a 90-year-old gray stone landmark on LaSalle Street in the heart of downtown, has been known to reach temperature substantially hotter than the actual temperature on the street below.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The garden will provide greenery and shade. &quot;And that,&quot; said the city officials, &quot;will save the city dollars on those blistering summer days.&quot; The project savings from cooling is about $4,000 a year on a new roof whose life span is about 50 percent longer than that of a traditional roof.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The sprawling open-air rooftop garden is being carefully built on a multi-tiered bed of special soil, polystyrene, egg-carton-shaped cones and &quot;waterproof membrane&quot; mall to keep the roof from leaking, or caving under the normal combined weight of soil, rain and plant life.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The design calls for soil depths of 4 inches to 18 inches. When the last plants and seedlings are buried and the last bit of compost is laid, the garden will have circular brick stepping-stones winding up to hills.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　&quot;The primary focus of what we want to do was to establish this laboratory on the top of City Hall to get people involved and understanding their impact on the environment and how the little things can make an impact on the quality of life&quot;, Mr. Abolt said, adding that the plants also help to clear the air.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Rooftop gardens, in places where concrete jungles have erased plants and trees, are not new, not even in Chicago. Arms of greenery dangling over terraces or sprouting from rooftops, common in Europe, are becoming more so in the United States as people become increasingly conscious about the environment.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Richard M. Daley, who urged the environmental department to look into the project after noticing rooftop gardens in Hamburg, Germany a few years ago, has praised the garden as the first of its kind on a public building in the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　It will hold thousands of plants in more than 150 species-wild onion and butterfly weed, sky-blue aster and buffalo grass-to provide data on what species adapt best. Small plants requiring shallow soil depths were chiefly selected.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　57. The rooftop garden project ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] is common and popular in the country</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] is a demonstration project and costs the city government 1.5 million dollars</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] will make the ordinary cooling down of the city in summer unnecessary</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] aims at getting people involved and understanding their impact on the environment</p>\n<p>\n\t　　58. What can we learn about the City Hall?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] It was built ninety years ago and is the most outstanding feature in the center of the city.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] It is originally proper to build a garden on the top of the City Hall.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] The temperature on its top is a little bit lower than that on the street below.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] It is the first building in America to have a garden on it.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　59. Which of the following statements is TRUE?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] Every year, Chicago spends about $ 4,000 on cooling the city.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] The design of the garden on the City Hall specially takes into consideration the weight the roof can stand.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] The Mayor urged the environmental department to look into rooftop gardens in Hamburg and build similar ones in America.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] Heat islands mainly refer to those dark-colored rooftops which receive and retain heat and will not easily release the heat.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　60. Why should the rooftop garden be built on the top of City Hall other than on any other buildings?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] Because the City Hall is large.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[B] Because the mayor had urged the environmental department to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[C] Because it can make people understand their impact on environment better through a public building.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[D] Because the experts just want to make the City Hall a convenient laboratory.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　61. The word &quot;substantially&quot; (Line 2, Para. 5) most likely means ________.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　[A] a little bit [B] in fact [C] materially [D] considerably</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;\">Part V Error Correction (15 minutes)</span></p>\n<p>\n\t　　Directions: This part consists of a short passage.

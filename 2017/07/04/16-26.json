Personally, the former is advisable for the following two reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirstly,in a society where more importance is attached to material civilization, it is natural to follow suit by majoring in science, so that one can hopefully make great contributions to the world in the future. As the very basis for spiritual enlightenment, material development is closely knitted with academic studies of science. For example, the daily appliances can not be invented without a comprehensive knowledge about physics and chemistry. Secondly, evidently, the significance of humanities&mdash;the pearl of mankind knowledge&mdash;cannot be exaggerated too much. However, since most subjects of humanities can be attained along withour personal development, it is axiomatic that we should focus more on the more challenging knowledge at college&mdash;science.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo conclude, both science and humanities have their distinctive lusters. But in view of practicality and difficulty, it is advisable that science be studied as a major at college.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong><br />\n\tPart II Listening Comprehension</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t1.B) Having friendly colleagues.<br />\n\t2.B) 20%.<br />\n\t3.A) Those of small size.<br />\n\t4.C) They can better balance work and life.<br />\n\t5.D) It is a collection of photos.<br />\n\t6.C) When taking pictures for a concert catalogue.<br />\n\t7.A) The entire European coastline will be submerged.<br />\n\t8.D) Tourists use wooden paths to reach their hotels in the morning.<br />\n\t9.C) They spend too much time anticipation their defeat.<br />\n\t10.D) Thinking has the same effect on the nervous system as doing.<br />\n\t11.C) Picture themselves succeeding.<br />\n\t12.B) She won her first jury trial.<br />\n\t13.C) It helps people to avoid developing breast cancer.<br />\n\t14.D) It tracked their eating habits since their adolescence.<br />\n\t15.A) Fiber may help to reduce hormones in the body.<br />\n\t16.B) Conducting research on consumer behavior.<br />\n\t17.D) It is an act of socializing.<br />\n\t18.A) They spent a week studying their own purchasing behavior.<br />\n\t19.D) It is likely to give up paper money in the near future.<br />\n\t20.C) Whether the absence of physical currency causes a person to spend more.<br />\n\t21.C) The restaurant car accepted cash only.<br />\n\t22.A) By putting money into envelopes.<br />\n\t23.B) Chronic hunger.<br />\n\t24.B) About half of them are unintended.<br />\n\t25.A) It is essential to the wellbeing of all species on earth.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong><br />\n\tPartIII Reading Comprehension</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\t26.L)significant 27.

During this period,the thriving handicrafts industry fostered the development of market economy and urbanization. Commodities, including alcohol and silk products, were available on the market in large quantities. At the same time, clocks and tobacco products, among many other foreign goods, were imported. Beijing, Nanjing,Yangzhou and Suzhou emerged as large commercial centers one after another. It was also during the Ming Dynasty that fleets headed by Navigator Zheng He made seven large-scale, adventurous voyages to the Indian Ocean. What is also worth mentioning is that three of the Four Great Classical Novels of China were written during this period.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>相关阅读：</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179939/\" target=\"_blank\">权威--2017年6月六级答案修订版(第二套)</a></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179940/\" target=\"_blank\">权威--2017年6月六级答案修订版(第三套)</a></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179938/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179938\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p751851/\">有声双语美文：遵从本心，做你自己</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1181268/\">Quora精选：哪10件事最值得你花时间去做？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1181351/\">史上最高气温出现，53度……伊朗人很无奈</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182398/\">王者荣耀推出最强管控，小学生只能玩1小时</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1181942/\">为什么人们都爱给别人贴标签？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1180401/\">神奇：跑步可以锻炼大脑？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182408/\">黑科技：迪拜要出现机械警察了？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1181270/\">H&amp;M这件T恤告诉我们，英语不好真要命</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1181331/\">与时间有关的英语俚语（五）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182483/\">新研究：睡懒觉可以减肥？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

Some choose to stay home, while others prefer the latter. If I were one of them, I would choose to study abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, studying abroad can broaden our horizon. When we study abroad, we can make friends with people from different cultures and learn about other lifestyles. It will help cultivate a global point of view, which is very important in this era. Secondly, studying abroad can foster self-dependence. When we stay overseas, we have to rely on ourselves to solve whatever problem we may encounter. Such self-dependence is beneficial to us in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are many concerns about studying abroad, such as safety. However, if we take proper precautions, we can ensure our safety. Therefore, after carefully weighing the advantages against the disadvantages of studying abroad, I still consider it apreferential choice.</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\t<span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong>&nbsp;Part II Listening Comprehension</strong></span><br />\n\t（全国共两套听力试题，在此不再重复）</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong>PartIII Reading Comprehension</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t26.F)focused 27.

The 300 years of rapid development during the Tang Dynasty turned China into the most prosperous power, with Chang&rsquo;an, the then capital, becoming the largest metropolis in the world. China during this period boasted economic boom, commercial prosperity and social stability. It even opened its borders to the outside world. As the country got more urbanized and wealthier, art and literature also flourished. Li Bai and Du Fu were poets known for their plain and simple works. Their poetry touched the hearts of scholars and commoners alike. Many of their poems are still widely read and recited by both children and adults today.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>相关阅读：</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179938/\" target=\"_blank\">权威--2017年6月六级答案修订版(第一套)</a></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179939/\" target=\"_blank\">权威--2017年6月六级答案修订版(第二套)</a></p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179940/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p1179940\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p823143/\">有声双语美文：土豆、鸡蛋与咖啡豆的哲理</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1183307/\">因为王者荣耀，腾讯突然赔了140亿美元</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182486/\">假期不可不看的5本好书</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182902/\">这个地方，把失恋做成了一门生意</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182831/\">《权力的游戏》最终季，每集长达80分钟！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182493/\">受不了网络骚扰，黄老板弃用推特</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1178205/\">100年前的生活妙招：用别针穿裤腰带</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1182487/\">水果姐的新单曲很高调：别把女人当玩物！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p1181347/\">与时间有关的英语俚语（六）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p779782/\">有声双语美文：感激之心，改变世界的力量</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

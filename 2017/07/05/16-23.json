For me, vocational education can be lucrative and fulfilling as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo begin with, there is an urgent call for skilled workers from the market. Employers often complain about the severe shortage of workers with expertise. In exchange of such talents, enterprisers are willing to offer a handsome sum of salary. Therefore,graduates from vocational colleges have a promising future in the monetary sense. In addition, graduates from vocational colleges can be spiritually fulfilling too. The prejudice against vocational training is being modified.Whatever degree a student gets, what counts most is the contribution he makesto the society. With the specialty they have accumulated from vocational colleges as well as academic studies, students can realize their value with the extra edge over those university students who are generally barren of practical skills.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll in all, it is crystal clear that vocational courses are no longer inferior to a university degree. Rather, it is filling a gap which college education is not necessarily covering when it comes to equipped young people with practical skills for the workplace.</p>\n<p>\n\tPart II Listening Comprehension</p>\n<p>\n\t1.A) He would feel insulted.<br />\n\t2.D)They need improvement<br />\n\t3.A) He seldom writes a book straight through.<br />\n\t4.D) Unlike a football match, there is no end to writing a book.<br />\n\t5.C) High college dropout rates among black athletes.<br />\n\t6.D) They make money for the college but often fail to earn a degree.<br />\n\t7.C) Slightly over 50%.<br />\n\t8.A) Coaches lack the incentive to graduate them.<br />\n\t9.B) Holiday shopping.<br />\n\t10.D) About 183.8 million.<br />\n\t11.C) They are thriving once more.<br />\n\t12.B) Higher employment and wages.<br />\n\t13.D)They are antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<br />\n\t14.D)Routine operations have become complex.<br />\n\t15.C)Money.<br />\n\t16.B) It improves students&rsquo; ability to think.<br />\n\t17.A) They encourage academic democracy.<br />\n\t18.A) His thirst for knowledge.<br />\n\t19.D) People tend to underestimate their mental powers.<br />\n\t20.B) They include more or less the same number of states.<br />\n\t21.C) Reviewing your lessons where the exam is to take place.<br />\n\t22.A) Discover when you can learn best.<br />\n\t23.C）He is a sociologist.<br />\n\t24.D) In developing countries.<br />\n\t25.B) Their income is less than 50% of the national average family income.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong><br />\n\tPartIII Reading Comprehension<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t26.K)referred 27.

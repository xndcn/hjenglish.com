In the left picture &hellip;&hellip;, while in the right &hellip;&hellip;.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the two pictures we can sense a crazy tendency of &hellip;&hellip;. Aside from &hellip;&hellip;, another telling example is &hellip;&hellip;, which was so successful in that &hellip;&hellip;. The pictures also make it obvious that we should &hellip;&hellip;.</p>\n<p>\n\tAdmittedly, it is natural that &hellip;&hellip;. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of our government and society to &hellip;&hellip;. In my opinion, what&rsquo;s the more important is to &hellip;&hellip;. In short, &hellip;&hellip;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>社会热点类模板2：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tIt goes without saying that this picture aims at revealing a current problem &hellip;&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seems to me that the artist is sending a message about the importance of &hellip;&hellip;. Though the drawing is a little exaggerating, it is not rare for us to find in &hellip;&hellip;. If we let this situation of continues,it not only harms &hellip;&hellip;, but also prevents &hellip;&hellip;.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccordingly,we urgently call for &hellip;&hellip;. Though the government has already taken pains to implement regulations,it still failz to &hellip;&hellip;. In my opinion,this problem should be urgently solved so as to protect benefits. I expect the government will put forward more effective propositions as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>家庭关系类模板1：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe cartoon reveals a very thought-provoking scene. The artist purposefully exaggerates&hellip;&hellip; . This picture reveals the in-depth problem of&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact,&hellip;&hellip; . There are two reasons for this. The first and perhaps most important is that&hellip;&hellip; . The other reason is more serious from a practical point of view.&hellip;&hellip; . It owes to&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my point of view, the trend goes quite against the genuine and original purpose of our&hellip;&hellip; . What I want to emphasize by the above analysis is that, &hellip;&hellip; Therefore, &hellip;&hellip; I strongly contend that&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>家庭关系类模板2：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a popular Chinese song, named &quot;&hellip;&hellip; &quot;, which encourages&hellip;&hellip; . However, the in the picture does but for a very different reason&mdash;&hellip;&hellip; . From the facial expression of we can read&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tSadly as it is, this phenomenon does not occur rarely in today's society, for which are responsible. For one thing,&hellip;&hellip; . For another,&hellip;&hellip; . As a matter of fact, the boosting economic development in China sadly and ironically witnesses a deterioration of&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tThe above analysis is best exemplified by&hellip;&hellip; . In my opinion, the awareness of is elementary for paving the way towards success.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>人生价值类模板1：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tAs the old Chinese saying goes, &hellip;&hellip; . It echoes with this picture in which&hellip;&hellip; . The title of the picture further points out that&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tThe picture is meant to&hellip;&hellip; . As far as I am concerned, I think&hellip;&hellip; . This universal truth can be particularly proved in the field of&hellip;&hellip; , where&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tA brief survey of history about also demonstrates the fundamental importance of&hellip;&hellip; .&hellip;&hellip; , for example,&hellip;&hellip; . The same principle applies to common people as well, and I am sure everybody can benefit from&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>人生价值类模板2：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the picture we can perceive that&hellip;&hellip; . What astonishes the drawing and the readers is that&hellip;&hellip; . It is known to all that&hellip;&hellip; , but it seems&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tThe artist utilizes this artistic presentation to imply a spreading vogue that&hellip;&hellip; . Ultimately, the trend boils down to&hellip;&hellip; . Accordingly,&hellip;&hellip; . To worsen the problem, this behavior is evoking&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my point of view, we are in a prime time to curb the problem from deteriorating. First and foremost， the whole society should arrive at the consensus that&hellip;&hellip; . Besides， an awareness of should be infused into everybody's mind.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>文化交流类模板1：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tIt is a very eye-catching photo in which&hellip;&hellip; . What makes this picture extraordinary is &hellip;&hellip;, which clearly indicates&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tThe sense of that permeates this picture is representative of&hellip;&hellip; , that is,&hellip;&hellip; , and therefore&hellip;&hellip; . China, in particular&hellip;&hellip; . The effect of such communication can be best exemplified by &hellip;&hellip;. .</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile people belong to nations, cultures know no boundary. &hellip;&hellip;is not only featured by&hellip;&hellip; ,but more importantly, by&hellip;&hellip; . I firmly believe that is contributing, and will contribute more to the world&rsquo;s peace, development, and prosperity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>文化交流类模板2：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is presented here is a very interesting scenario&hellip;&hellip; . From the subtitle we can infer that&hellip;&hellip; . Conspicuously,&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can deduce from the picture that&hellip;&hellip; . It partly owes to&hellip;&hellip; , and partly to&hellip;&hellip; . Except the case reflected in the picture, there are numerous evidence demonstrating&hellip;&hellip; . For example,&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom a personal point of view, I am delighted to witness &hellip;&hellip;. To sum up,&hellip;&hellip; . As for China,&hellip;&hellip; . Therefore,&hellip;&hellip;. I can firmly conclude that in the long run, cultural exchanges will contribute to a flourishing Chinese and global economy, as well as diversified cultures.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>教育类模板1：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tAs the title indicates, &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip; &rdquo;, the set of pictures apparently reminds us that&hellip;&hellip; . It is discernable that&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tThe drawing virtually reminds its audience a widespread phenomenon existing negatively in the area of basic education in China, that is,&hellip;&hellip; . That is to say,&hellip;&hellip; . Such a practice is very harmful in terms of the following aspects.Firstly,&hellip;&hellip; . Secondly,&hellip;&hellip; . Last but not the least,&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my point of view,&hellip;&hellip; , but it is only part of the picture. On the other hand,&hellip;&hellip; . Therefore, it is an urgent task to&hellip;&hellip; . As children are the future of our nation, creating a good environment for their upbringing means creating a bright and promising future for our nation.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>教育类模板2：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe picture shows&hellip;&hellip; . symbolizes&hellip;&hellip; . As is quoted in the picture,&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIt apparently mirrors an increasingly common social phenomenon in China&mdash; in contrast with&hellip;&hellip; . One the one hand， the problem partially attributes to&hellip;&hellip; . Sometimes&hellip;&hellip; . On the other hand,&hellip;&hellip; . For example,&hellip;&hellip; ,while&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my opinion, the government needs to launch a reform in the education system with measures that can show immediate effect. proves to be most beneficial to students. Further, a large-scale reform in the macroeconomic level to is the basic solution of this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>对比论证类模板1：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the two pictures presented, it can be observed that. In the left picture,&hellip;&hellip; . A the same time， as the right one shows. Different people have different views on&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tSome people support by claiming that&hellip;&hellip; . In their opinion,&hellip;&hellip; . In addition,&hellip;&hellip; . Meanwhile, there are some people, especially young men, who&hellip;&hellip; . Their reasons are quite different, sometimes for&hellip;&hellip; , sometimes for&hellip;&hellip; , sometimes simply for&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my point of view, both sides are partly right. To thoroughly analyze this problem, we should take into consideration of all relevant aspects, so as to make the right decision. Therefore, my conclusion would be that&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>对比论证类模板2：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the drawing, we can learn that&hellip;&hellip; . It can be seen easily that&hellip;&hellip; . We can deduce from that people&rsquo;s opinion on vary from person to person.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome people take it for granted that&hellip;&hellip; . For example， they firmly believe that&hellip;&hellip; . But they often neglect that fact that&hellip;&hellip; . Yet there are also another group of people who hold a different point of view. They think that&hellip;&hellip; . Beside,&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tPersonally, my attitude for this matter is positive, with reasons as follows. Firstly,&hellip;&hellip; . Moreover,&hellip;&hellip; . Lastly,&hellip;&hellip; . Therefore,&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>情感类模板1：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tAs is shown in the picture above,&hellip;&hellip;　. Obviously from we can surmise that &hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tIt goes without saying that the primary purpose of the picture lies in eulogizing the practice of &hellip;&hellip; . As a matter of fact, it is not rare to find in our everyday life deeds of similar nature.For instance,&hellip;&hellip; . Additionally, we can also hear many stories about &hellip;&hellip; .Not to mention those moving cases of &hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tAll in all, I firmly believe that a harmonious society is based on a &hellip;&hellip; . By &hellip;&hellip;, people not only harvest &hellip;&hellip;, but also gain that can never be purchased via money.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>情感类模板2：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tJust as is depicted in the picture. It is not difficult to find that in today&rsquo;s society， more and more people begin to &hellip;&hellip; . It is rather good news to &hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\tThe picture reminds us that in China, due to ,&hellip;&hellip; . Moreover, there are &hellip;&hellip; .In addition， we should not forget &hellip;&hellip;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&hellip;&hellip;is a good way to express human love. To some extent, it also reflects individuals' sense of social responsibility. It is also a feeling from deep heart that is beyond words and is difficult to obtain no matter how rich one is. Therefore, I strongly advocate that&hellip;&hellip; . I am sure our society will hence be more beautiful because of&hellip;&hellip; .</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #b22222;\"><strong>考研英语大作文模板（展望未来型）：<br />\n\t</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tWith the rapid advances of _____________ in recent years, ___has____________（引出现象）.

Thank you, Dr. Kissinger, for your kind introduction. Dr. Kissinger has always been able to come up with some new observations. His introduction has really given me a new perspective to look at myself. It is great to be among so many friends, old and new, in the State of Washington and the City of Seattle, the first leg of my state visit to the United States. Let me begin by extending to you and, through you, to all the American people, my cordial greetings and best wishes.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t我对华盛顿州和西雅图市并不陌生。人们常说，华盛顿州是&ldquo;常青之州&rdquo;，西雅图市是&ldquo;翡翠之城&rdquo;。这里有雄伟挺拔的雷尼尔山、波光潋滟的华盛顿湖。电影《西雅图不眠夜》使这座城市在中国民众中有很大吸引力。目前，华盛顿州对华出口居全美之首，中国也成为西雅图港最大贸易伙伴。华盛顿州和西雅图市成为中美人民友谊、中美互利合作的一个重要象征。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">I am no stranger to the State of Washington and the City of Seattle. Known as the Evergreen State and the Emerald City, here you have got the majestic Mt. Rainier and the charming Lake Washington. The film Sleepless in Seattle has made the city almost a household name in China. Besides, Washington is the leading state in U.S. export to China and China the number one trading partner of the Port of Seattle. Washington and Seattle have become an important symbol of the friendship between Chinese and American people and the win-win cooperation between the two countries.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t众人拾柴火焰高。中美关系发展，离不开两国政府、地方、友好团体、各界人士的辛勤耕耘和精心呵护。特别是美中关系全国委员会、美中贸易全国委员会、美中政策基金会、美国商会、美国中国总商会、百人会、华美协进社、对外关系委员会、亚洲协会、布鲁金斯学会等友好团体和一大批友好人士，长期为促进两国友好合作奔走努力。中美关系持续发展，凝聚着大家的心血和汗水。在这里，我谨向所有致力于中美友好事业的地方政府、社会团体、大学和智库机构及各界人士，表示由衷的敬意和诚挚的感谢！<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">As a Chinese saying goes, the fire burns high when everyone brings wood to it. It is the loving care and hard work of the national governments, local authorities, friendly organizations and people from all walks of life in both countries that have made China-U.S. relations flourish. In particular, the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Business Council, the U.S.-China Policy Foundation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA, the Committee of 100, the China Institute, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society, the Brookings Institution and many other friendly groups and individuals have made untiring efforts over the years to promote friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries and brought the relationship to this far. Let me pay high tribute and express my heartfelt gratitude to all the local governments, social organizations, universities, think tanks and people from all sectors of society who have dedicated themselves to the cause of China-U.S. friendship.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t女士们、先生们、朋友们！<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"></span></div>\n<div>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Ladies and Gentlemen,</span></div>\n<div>\n\tDear Friends,</div>\n<p>\n\t</p>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t新中国成立以来特别是改革开放以来，中国走过了一段很不平凡的历程，我们这一代中国人对此有着切身的体会。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Since the founding of the People&rsquo;s Republic, especially since the beginning of reform and opening-up, China has set out on an extraordinary journey, and the Chinese of my generation have had some first-hand experience.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t上世纪60年代末，我才十几岁，就从北京到中国陕西省延安市一个叫梁家河的小村庄插队当农民，在那儿度过了7年时光。那时候，我和乡亲们都住在土窑里、睡在土炕上，乡亲们生活十分贫困，经常是几个月吃不到一块肉。我了解乡亲们最需要什么！后来，我当了这个村子的党支部书记，带领乡亲们发展生产。我了解老百姓需要什么。我很期盼的一件事，就是让乡亲们饱餐一顿肉，并且经常吃上肉。但是，这个心愿在当时是很难实现的。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Towards the end of the 1960s when I was in my teens, I was sent from Beijing to work as a farmer in a small village of Liangjiahe near Yan&rsquo;an of Shaanxi Province, where I spent seven years. At that time, the villagers and I lived in &ldquo;earth caves&rdquo; and slept on &ldquo;earth beds&rdquo;. Life was very hard. There was no meat in our diet for months. I knew what the villagers wanted the most. Later I became the village&rsquo;s party secretary and began to lead the villagers in production. I understood their needs. One thing I wished most at the time was to make it possible for the villagers to have meat and have it often. But it was very difficult for such a wish to come true in those years.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t今年春节，我回到这个小村子。梁家河修起了柏油路，乡亲们住上了砖瓦房，用上了互联网，老人们享有基本养老，村民们有医疗保险，孩子们可以接受良好教育，当然吃肉已经不成问题。这使我更加深刻地认识到，中国梦是人民的梦，必须同中国人民对美好生活的向往结合起来才能取得成功。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">At the Spring Festival early this year, I returned to the village. I saw blacktop roads. Now living in houses with bricks and tiles, the villagers had Internet access. Elderly folks had basic old-age care and all villagers had medical care coverage. Children were in school. Of course, meat was readily available. This made me keenly aware that the Chinese Dream is after all a dream of the people. We can fulfill the Chinese Dream only when we link it with our people&rsquo;s yearning for a better life.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t梁家河这个小村庄的变化，是改革开放以来中国社会发展进步的一个缩影。我们用了30多年时间，使中国经济总量跃居世界第二，13亿多人摆脱了物质短缺，总体达到小康水平，享有前所未有的尊严和权利。这不仅是中国人民生活的巨大变化，也是人类文明的巨大进步，更是中国对世界和平与发展事业的重要贡献。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">What has happened in Liangjiahe is but a microcosm of the progress China has made through reform and opening-up. In a little more than three decades, we have turned China into the world&rsquo;s second largest economy, lifted l.3 billion people from a life of chronic shortage and brought them initial prosperity and unprecedented rights and dignity. This is not only a great change in the lives of the Chinese people, but also a huge step forward in human civilization and China&rsquo;s major contribution to world peace and development.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t同时，我们也清醒认识到，中国仍然是世界上最大的发展中国家。中国的人均国内生产总值仅相当于全球平均水平的三分之二、美国的七分之一，排在世界80位左右。按照我们自己的标准，中国还有7000多万贫困人口。如果按照世界银行的标准，中国则还有两亿多人生活在贫困线以下。中国城乡有7000多万低保人口，还有8500多万残疾人。这两年，我去了中国很多贫困地区，看望了很多贫困家庭，他们渴望幸福生活的眼神深深印在我的脑海里。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">At the same time, we are soberly aware that China is still the world&rsquo;s largest developing country. Our per capita GDP is only two thirds that of the global average and one seventh that of the United States, ranking around 80th in the world. By China&rsquo;s own standard, we still have over 70 million people living under the poverty line. If measured by the World Bank standard, the number would be more than 200 million. Over 70 million citizens live on basic living allowances, and the number of people with disabilities exceeds 85 million. During the past two years, I have been to many poor areas in China and visited many poor families. I wouldn&rsquo;t forget the look in their eyes longing for a decent, happy life.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t\n\t<div>\n\t\t这些情况表明，中国人民要过上美好生活，还要继续付出艰苦努力。发展依然是当代中国的第一要务，中国执政者的首要使命就是集中力量提高人民生活水平，逐步实现共同富裕。为此，我们提出了&ldquo;两个一百年&rdquo;奋斗目标，就是到2020年实现国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，全面建成小康社会；到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家，实现中华民族伟大复兴。我们现在所做的一切，都是为了实现这个既定目标。实现全面建成小康社会，必须全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党。这就是我们提出的&ldquo;四个全面&rdquo;战略布局。</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">I know that we must work still harder before all our people can live a better life. That explains why development remains China&rsquo;s top priority. To any one charged with the governance of China, their primary mission is to focus all the resources on improving people&rsquo;s living standard and gradually achieve common prosperity. To this end, we have proposed the two centenary goals, i.e. to double the 2010 GDP and per capita income of the Chinese and complete the building of a moderately prosperous society by 2020 and to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious modern socialist country and realize the great renewal of the Chinese nation by the middle of the century. Whatever we do now is aimed at fulfilling these goals. To succeed in completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, we must comprehensively deepen reform, advance law-based governance, and apply strict party discipline. That is what our proposed Four-pronged Strategy is all about.</span></p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t大家都关心中国的发展走向，关心中国的政策取向，这里，我就其中一些主要的问题讲几点意见。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Since you are all interested in such issues as the direction of China&rsquo;s development and China&rsquo;s policy orientation, let me take this opportunity to share with you some of my thoughts in this regard.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&mdash;&mdash;中国经济将保持平稳较快发展。中国经济运行仍然保持在合理区间，今年上半年，中国经济增长7%，增速仍然居世界前列。在世界总体经济形势复杂多变的环境下，这是来之不易的。当前，各国经济都面临着困难，中国经济也面临着一定下行压力，但这是前进中的问题。我们将统筹稳增长、促改革、调结构、惠民生、防风险，加强和创新宏观调控，促进经济增长保持中高速水平。现在，中国新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化持续推进，居民储蓄率高，消费潜力巨大，人民工作勤奋，中等收入者比重在提高，服务业发展空间很大，市场空间和潜力都很大。今后，中国将更重视提高经济发展质量和效益，加快转变经济发展方式、调整经济结构，更加注重创新驱动，更加注重消费拉动，更加注重解决经济发展中存在的不平衡、不协调、不可持续问题，使中国经济凤凰涅槃、浴火重生，保持强劲发展动力。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">&ndash; China&rsquo;s economy will stay on a steady course with fairly fast growth. The Chinese economy is still operating within a proper range. It grew by 7 percent in the first half of the year, and this growth rate remains one of the highest in the world. This has not come by easily given the complex and volatile situation in the world economy. At present, all economies are facing difficulties, and our economy is also under downward pressure. But this is only a problem in the course of progress. We will take coordinated steps to achieve stable growth, deepen reform, adjust structure, improve livelihood and prevent risks, while strengthening and innovating macro regulation to keep the growth at a medium-high speed. Currently, China is continuing to move forward its new type of industrialization, digitalization, urbanization and agricultural modernization. China has a high savings rate, a huge consumption potential, a hard-working population and a rising proportion of middle-income people. This creates an enormous space for the services sector and offers a big market with great potential. China will focus more on improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth and accelerating the shift of growth model and adjustment in economic structure. We will lay greater emphasis on innovation and consumption-driven growth. In this way, we will solve the problem of unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable development and enable the Chinese economy to successfully transform itself and maintain strong momentum of growth.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t前段时间，中国股市出现了异常波动，引起了大家关注。股市涨跌有其自身的运行规律。政府的职责是维护公开、公平、公正的市场秩序，防止发生大面积恐慌。这次，中国政府采取了一些稳定市场的措施，遏制了股市的恐慌情绪，避免了一次系统性风险。各国成熟市场也采取过类似做法。中国股市已经进入自我修复和自我调节阶段。8月11日，中国完善了人民币汇率中间价报价机制，加大了市场决定汇率的力度。目前，人民币汇率偏差矫正已初见成效。从国际国内经济金融形势看，人民币汇率不存在持续贬值的基础。我们将坚持市场供求决定汇率的改革方向，允许人民币双向浮动，我们反对搞货币竞争性贬值，反对打货币战，也不会压低人民币汇率刺激出口。发展资本市场、完善人民币汇率市场定价机制是中国的改革方向，不会因为这次股市、汇市波动而改变。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Recent abnormal ups and downs in China&rsquo;s stock market has caused wide concern. Stock prices fluctuate in accordance with their inherent laws. And it is the duty of the government to ensure an open, fair and just market order and prevent massive panic from happening. This time, the Chinese government took steps to stabilize the market and contain panic in the stock market and thus avoided a systemic risk. Mature markets of various countries have tried similar approaches. Now, China&rsquo;s stock market has reached the phase of self-recovery and self-adjustment. On 11 August, China moved to improve its RMB central parity quotation mechanism, giving the market a greater role in determining the exchange rate. Our efforts have achieved initial success in correcting the exchange rate deviation. Given the economic and financial situation at home and abroad, there is no basis for continuous depreciation of the RMB. We will stick to the purpose of our reform to have the exchange rate decided by market supply and demand and allow the RMB to float both ways. We are against competitive depreciation or a currency war. We will not lower the RMB exchange rate to stimulate export. To develop the capital market and improve the market-based pricing mechanism of the RMB exchange rate is the direction of our reform. This will not be changed by the recent fluctuation in the stock market or the foreign exchange market.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&mdash;&mdash;中国发展的根本出路在于改革。我们改革的目标，就是推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用，加快发展社会主义市场经济、民主政治、先进文化、和谐社会、生态文明。2013年，中共十八届三中全会确定了全面深化改革的顶层设计，提出330多项改革措施。2014年，我们确定的80个重点改革任务基本完成。今年上半年，我们已经出台70多项重点改革方案，其作用将逐步显现。改革关头勇者胜，我们将以敢于啃硬骨头、敢于涉险滩的决心，义无反顾推进改革。我们坚定不移坚持市场经济改革方向，将继续在市场、财税、金融、投融资、价格、对外开放、民生等领域集中推出一些力度大、措施实的改革方案。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">&ndash; The key to China&rsquo;s development lies in reform. Our reform is aimed at modernizing the country&rsquo;s governance system and governance capabilities, so that the market can play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, the government can play a better role and there is faster progress in building the socialist market economy, democracy, advanced culture, harmonious society and sound environment. At the third Plenary Session of the 18th Party Central Committee in 2013, we decided on an overarching plan for deepening reform featuring over 330 measures. In 2014, 80 major reform items were by and large completed. In the first half of this year, we rolled out over 70 key reform programs, with their effects gradually becoming evident. When it comes to the toughest reforms, only those with courage will carry the day. We have the resolve and the guts to press ahead and take reform forward. We will stick to the direction of market economy reform and continue to introduce bold and result-oriented reform measures concerning the market, taxation, finance, investment and financing, pricing, opening-up and people&rsquo;s livelihood.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&mdash;&mdash;中国开放的大门永远不会关上。对外开放是中国的基本国策，中国利用外资的政策不会变，对外商投资企业合法权益的保障不会变，为各国企业在华投资兴业提供更好服务的方向不会变。中国尊重非歧视性规则的国际营商惯例，遵守国民待遇等世贸组织原则，公平公正对待包括外商投资企业在内的所有市场主体，欢迎跨国公司同中国企业开展各种形式合作。我们将及时解决外国投资者合理关切，保护他们的合法权益，努力营造公开透明的法律政策环境、高效的行政环境、平等竞争的市场环境，尤其是保护好知识产权，为我们同包括美国在内的世界各国开展合作开辟更加广阔的空间。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">&ndash; China will never close its open door to the outside world. Opening-up is a basic state policy of China. Its policies of attracting foreign investment will not change, nor will its pledge to protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in China and improve its services for foreign companies operating in China. We respect the international business norms and practices of non-discrimination, observe the WHO principle of national treatment, treat all market players including foreign-invested companies fairly, and encourage transnational corporations to engage in all forms of cooperation with Chinese companies. We will address legitimate concerns of foreign investors in a timely fashion, protect their lawful rights and interests and work hard to provide an open and transparent legal and policy environment, an efficient administrative environment and a level playing field in the market, with effective ID protection in particular, so as to broaden the space of cooperation between China and the United States and other countries.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&mdash;&mdash;中国坚持依法治国的基本方略。&ldquo;法者，治之端也。&rdquo;全面依法治国就是要坚持依法治国、依法执政、依法行政共同推进，坚持法治国家、法治政府、法治社会一体建设，推动司法公信力不断提高、人权得到切实尊重和保障。中国在立法、执法、司法等领域将公平对待外国机构和企业。我们愿同美方就法治问题开展交流，相互借鉴，共同提高。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">&ndash; China will follow the basic strategy of the rule of law in governance. &ldquo;Law is the very foundation of governance.&rdquo; We will coordinate our efforts to promote the rule of law in governance and administration, put the building of the country, the government and society on the solid basis of the rule of law, build greater trust in the judicial system and ensure that human rights are respected and effectively upheld. China will give fair treatment to foreign institutions and foreign companies in the country&rsquo;s legislative, executive and judicial practices. We are ready to discuss rule-of-law issues with the U.S. side in the spirit of mutual learning for common progress.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t中国是网络安全的坚定维护者。中国也是黑客攻击的受害国。中国政府不会以任何形式参与、鼓励或支持任何人从事窃取商业秘密行为。不论是网络商业窃密，还是对政府网络发起黑客攻击，都是违法犯罪行为，都应该根据法律和相关国际公约予以打击。国际社会应该本着相互尊重和相互信任的原则，共同构建和平、安全、开放、合作的网络空间。中国愿同美国建立两国共同打击网络犯罪高级别联合对话机制。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity. It is also a victim of hacking. The Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone. Both commercial cybertheft and hacking against government networks are crimes that must be punished in accordance with law and relevant international treaties. The international community should, on the basis of mutual respect and mutual trust, work together to build a peaceful, secure, open and cooperative cubers. China is ready to set up a high level joint dialogue mechanism with the United States on fighting cybercrime.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t中国肯定境外非营利组织的积极作用，只要这些组织的活动对中国人民有好处，我们不仅不会限制和禁止它们的活动，而且要通过法律保障它们的活动，保障它们在华合法权益。境外非营利组织在中国活动应该遵守中国法律，依法开展活动。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">China recognizes the positive role played by foreign non-profit organizations (NPO). So long as their activities are beneficial to the Chinese people, we will not restrict or prohibit their operations but will protect their operations through legislation and protect their legitimate rights and interests. On their part, foreign NPOs in China need to obey Chinese law and carry out activities in accordance with law.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&mdash;&mdash;中国继续推进反腐败斗争。我说过，打铁还需自身硬。这里说的打铁的人，就是中国共产党。中国共产党的根本宗旨是全心全意为人民服务。中国共产党有8700多万名党员，党内也必然存在这样那样的问题。如果我们不能解决存在的问题，任其发展下去，人民就不会信任和支持我们。所以，我们强调治国必先治党、治党务必从严。一段时间以来，我们大力查处腐败案件，坚持&ldquo;老虎&rdquo;、&ldquo;苍蝇&rdquo;一起打，就是要顺应人民要求。这其中没有什么权力斗争，没有什么&ldquo;纸牌屋&rdquo;。中国愿同国际社会积极开展反腐追逃合作。中国人民希望在这方面得到美国支持和配合，让腐败分子在海外永无&ldquo;避罪天堂&rdquo;。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">&ndash; China will continue fighting corruption. As I once said, one has to be very strong if he wants to strike the iron. The blacksmith referred to here is the Chinese Communist Party. The fundamental aim of the Party is to serve the people heart and soul. The Party now has over 87 million members, and unavoidably it has problems of one kind or another. If we let these problems go unchecked, we will risk losing the trust and support of the people. That is why we demand strict enforcement of party discipline as the top priority of governance. In our vigorous campaign against corruption, we have punished both &ldquo;tigers&rdquo; and &ldquo;flies&rdquo;, corrupt officials irrespective of ranking, in response to our people&rsquo;s demand. This has nothing to do with power struggle. It&rsquo;s nothing like what you see in House of Cards. China is ready to cooperate closely with international community in fighting corruption and tracking down fugitives. The Chinese people look to the U.S. for support and coordination so that corrupt elements will be denied an overseas &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo;.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&mdash;&mdash;中国坚持走和平发展道路。我们刚刚纪念了中国人民抗日战争胜利暨世界反法西斯战争胜利7O周年，历史给我们的一个重要启迪就是，和平发展是人间正道，一切通过武力侵略谋取强权和霸权的企图都是逆历史潮流的，都是要失败的。中国人2000多年前就认识到了&ldquo;国虽大，好战必亡&rdquo;的真理。中国历来奉行防御性国防政策和积极防御的军事战略。我愿在此重申，无论发展到哪一步，中国永远不称霸、永远不搞扩张。为表明中国坚持和平发展的决心，我不久前宣布中国将裁军30万。我们愿同各国一道，构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，以合作取代对抗，以共赢取代独占，树立建设伙伴关系新思路，开创共同发展新前景，营造共享安全新局面。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">&ndash; China will keep to the path of peaceful development. We have just commemorated the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People&rsquo;s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. An important lesson history teaches us is that peaceful development is the right path, while any attempt to seek domination or hegemony through force is against the historical tide and doomed to failure. The Chinese recognized as early as 2,000 years ago that &ldquo;though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin.&rdquo; China&rsquo;s defense policy is defensive in nature and its military strategy features active defense. Let me reiterate here that no matter how developed it could become, China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion. To demonstrate our commitment to peaceful development, I announced not long ago that the size of China&rsquo;s military will be cut by 300,000. China is ready to work with other countries to build a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation at its core, replacing confrontation and domination with win-win cooperation, and adopting a new thinking of building partnerships, so as to jointly open up a new vista of common development and shared security.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t中国是现行国际体系的参与者、建设者、贡献者。我们坚决维护以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为核心的国际秩序和国际体系。世界上很多国家特别是广大发展中国家都希望国际体系朝着更加公正合理方向发展，但这并不是推倒重来，也不是另起炉灶，而是与时俱进、改革完善。这符合世界各国和全人类共同利益。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">As far as the existing international system is concerned, China has been a participant, builder and contributor. We stand firmly for the international order and system that is based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. A great number of countries, especially developing countries, want to see a more just and equitable international system, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean they want to unravel the entire system or start all over again. Rather, what they want is to reform and improve the system to keep up with the times. This would serve the common interests of all countries and mankind as a whole.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t中国发展得益于国际社会，中国也要为全球发展作出贡献。我们推动共建&ldquo;一带一路&rdquo;、设立丝路基金、倡议成立亚洲基础设施投资银行等，目的是支持各国共同发展，而不是要谋求政治势力范围。&ldquo;一带一路&rdquo;是开放包容的，我们欢迎包括美国在内的世界各国和国际组织参与到合作中来。我们积极推动亚太区域经济一体化进程，推动实现亚太自由贸易区目标，是要推动形成自由开放、方便快捷、充满活力的亚太发展空间。我们倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，是要同地区各国以及国际社会一道，维护好亚太和平和安全。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">China has benefited from the international community in development, and China in turn has made its contribution to global development. Our &ldquo;Belt and Road&rdquo; initiative, our establishment of the Silk Road Fund and our proposal to set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are all aimed at helping the common development of all countries rather than seeking some kind of spheres of political influence. The &ldquo;Belt and Road&rdquo; initiative is open and inclusive. We welcome participation of the U.S. and other countries and international organizations. We have vigorously promoted economic integration in the Asia Pacific and the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific in particular, because we want to facilitate the shaping of a free, open, convenient and dynamic space for development in the Asia Pacific. We call for an outlook of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, because we want to work with other countries in the region and the rest of the international community to maintain peace and security in the Asia Pacific.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t女士们、先生们、朋友们！<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"></span></div>\n<div>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Ladies and Gentlemen,</span></div>\n<div>\n\tDear Friends,</div>\n<p>\n\t</p>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t2013年，我同奥巴马总统在安纳伯格庄园会晤，达成共同努力构建中美新型大国关系的重要共识。这是双方在总结历史经验基础上，从两国国情和世界大势出发，共同作出的重大战略抉择。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">In our Sunnylands meeting in 2013, President Obama and I reached the important agreement to jointly build a new model of major-country relationship between the two countries. This was a major, strategic choice we made together on the basis of historical experience, our respective national conditions and the prevailing trend of the world.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t两年多来，双方按照达成的共识，不断推进各领域协调和合作，取得重要进展。我们携手应对国际金融危机影响，为推动世界经济复苏作出共同努力。我们深化各领域务实交流合作，给两国人民带来实实在在的利益。去年，两国双边贸易额、双向投资存量、人员往来总数都创历史新高。我们围绕伊朗核、朝核、南苏丹、阿富汗、中东等国际和地区热点问题，以及抗击埃博拉病毒、打击恐怖主义等全球性问题保持密切沟通和协调。&ldquo;桃李不言，下自成蹊。&rdquo;这些成果丰硕的&ldquo;跨越太平洋的合作&rdquo;，有力展现了中美关系发展的蓬勃生机和巨大潜力。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Over the past two years and more, the two sides have acted in accordance with the agreement, steadily moved forward bilateral coordination and cooperation in various fields and made important progress. We worked hand in hand to cope with the aftermath of the international financial crisis and promoted global economic recovery. We deepened pragmatic exchanges and cooperation in all fields which brought about tangible benefits to the two peoples. Last year, bilateral trade, two-way investment stock and total number of personnel exchanges all hit a record high. We maintained close communication and coordination on such international and regional hotspot issues as the Iranian nuclear issue, the Korean nuclear issue, South Sudan, Afghanistan, the Middle East as well as such global issues as fighting against Ebola and countering terrorism. As an old Chinese saying goes, &ldquo;Peaches and plums do not talk, yet a path is formed beneath them.&rdquo; These worthy fruits of cooperation across the Pacific Ocean speaks eloquently to the vitality and potential of China-U.S. relations.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t如何在新起点上推进中美新型大国关系？中美应该怎样携手合作来促进世界和平与发展？答案就是要坚持构建中美新型大国关系的正确方向，一步一个脚印向前走。中国古人说：&ldquo;度之往事，验之来事，参之平素，可则决之。&rdquo;这其中，有几件事尤其要做好。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">This leads to the question: what shall we do to advance the new model of major country relationship between China and the U.S. from a new starting point and how can we work together to promote world peace and development? The answer, in my view, is to stick to the right direction of such a new model of relationship and make gradual yet solid progress. An ancient Chinese said, &ldquo;A decision can be properly made after taking into account the past, the future and the normal practices.&rdquo; A number of things are particularly important for our efforts.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t第一，正确判断彼此战略意图。同美方一道构建新型大国关系，实现双方不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢，是中国外交政策优先方向。我们愿同美方加深对彼此战略走向、发展道路的了解，多一些理解、少一些隔阂，多一些信任、少一些猜忌，防止战略误解误判。我们要坚持以事实为依据，防止三人成虎，也不疑邻盗斧，不能戴着有色眼镜观察对方。世界上本无&ldquo;修昔底德陷阱&rdquo;，但大国之间一再发生战略误判，就可能自己给自己造成&ldquo;修昔底德陷阱&rdquo;。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">First, we must read each other&rsquo;s strategic intentions correctly. Building a new model of major-country relationship with the United States that features non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation is the priority of China&rsquo;s foreign policy. We want to deepen mutual understanding with the U.S. on each other&rsquo;s strategic orientation and development path. We want to see more understanding and trust, less estrangement and suspicion, in order to forestall misunderstanding and miscalculation. We should strictly base our judgment on facts, lest we become victims to hearsay, paranoid or self-imposed bias. There is no such thing as the so-called Thucydides trap in the world. But should major countries time and again make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation, they might create such traps for themselves.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t第二，坚定不移推进合作共赢。合作是实现利益唯一正确选择。要合作就要照顾彼此利益和关切，寻求合作最大公约数。中美两国合作好了，可以成为世界稳定的压舱石、世界和平的助推器。中美冲突和对抗，对两国和世界肯定是灾难。中美应该和能够合作的领域十分广阔。我们应该推动完善全球治理机制，共同促进世界经济稳定增长，共同维护全球金融市场稳定。我们应该早日谈成一个双向平衡、高水平的双边投资协定，深化中美新型军事关系建设，拓展在清洁能源、环保等领域务实合作，加强在执法和反腐败、卫生、地方等领域交流合作，挖掘在基础设施建设方面的合作潜力。我们应该深化在联合国、亚太经合组织、二十国集团等多边机制以及重大国际和地区问题、全球性挑战上的沟通和合作，为维护和促进世界和平、稳定、繁荣作出更大贡献。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Second, we must firmly advance win-win cooperation. Cooperation is the only right choice to bring about benefits. But cooperation requires mutual accommodation of each other&rsquo;s interests and concerns and the quest of the greatest common ground of converging interests. If China and the United States cooperate well, they can become a bedrock of global stability and a booster of world peace. Should they enter into conflict or confrontation, it would lead to disaster for both countries and the world at large. The areas where we should, and can, cooperate are very broad. For instance, we should help improve the global governance mechanism and work together to promote a sustained growth of world economy and maintain stability in the global financial market. We should conclude as soon as possible a balanced and high-quality Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), deepen the building of a new type of mil-to-mil relations between the two countries, expand pragmatic cooperation on clean energy and environmental protection, strengthen exchanges on law enforcement, anti-corruption, health and local affairs and tap the cooperation potential in infrastructural development. We should deepen communication and cooperation at the United Nations, APEC, G20 and other multilateral mechanisms as well as on major international and regional issues and global challenges, so as to make a bigger contribution to world peace, stability and prosperity.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t第三，妥善有效管控分歧。&ldquo;日月不同光，昼夜各有宜。&rdquo;正是因为有了差别，世界才多姿多彩；也正是因为有了分歧，才需要聚同化异。矛盾是普遍存在的，纯而又纯的世界是不存在的。中美两国在一些问题上存在不同看法、存在分歧在所难免，关键是如何管控。最关键的是双方应该相互尊重、求同存异，采取建设性方式增进理解、扩大共识，努力把矛盾点转化为合作点。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Third, we must manage our differences properly and effectively. As a Chinese saying goes, &ldquo;The sun and the moon shine in different ways, yet their brightness is just right for the day and the night respectively.&rdquo; It is precisely because of so many differences that the world has become such a diverse and colorful place, and that the need to broaden common ground and iron out differences has become so important. A perfectly pure world is non-existent since disagreements are a reality people have to live with. China and the United States do not see eye to eye on every issue, and it is unavoidable that we may have different positions on some of the issues. What matters is how to manage the differences. And what matters most is that the two sides should respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, take a constructive approach to enhance understanding and expand consensus and spare no effort to turn differences into areas of cooperation.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t第四，广泛培植人民友谊。国家关系归根结底是人民之间的关系。中美两国虽然相距遥远，但两国人民友好交往源远流长。230多年前，美国商船&ldquo;中国皇后号&rdquo;跨洋过海首航中国。150年前，数以万计的中国工人同美国人民一起，铺设了横贯东西的美国太平洋铁路。70年前，中美作为第二次世界大战盟国并肩奋战，共同捍卫了世界和平和正义。在那场战争中，数以千计的美国将士为中国人民的正义事业献出了宝贵生命。我们不会忘记美国人民为中国人民抗击侵略、赢得自由和独立给予的道义支持和宝贵援助。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Fourth, we must foster friendly sentiments among our peoples. People-to-people relations underpin state-to-state relations. Though geographically far apart, our peoples boast a long history of friendly exchanges. Some 230 years ago, Empress of China, a U.S. merchant ship, sailed across vast oceans to the shores of China. Some 150 years ago, tens of thousands of Chinese workers joined their American counterparts in building the trans-continental Pacific Railway. Some 70 years ago, China and the United States, as allies in World War II, fought shoulder to shoulder, to defend world peace and justice. In that war, thousands of American soldiers laid down their precious lives for the just cause of the Chinese people. We will never forget the moral support and invaluable assistance the American people gave to our just resistance against aggression and our struggle for freedom and independence.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t中国人民一向钦佩美国人民的进取精神和创造精神。我青年时代就读过《联邦党人文集》、托马斯&middot;潘恩的《常识》等著作，也喜欢了解华盛顿、林肯、罗斯福等美国政治家的生平和思想，我还读过梭罗、惠特曼、马克&middot;吐温、杰克&middot;伦敦等人的作品。海明威《老人与海》对狂风和暴雨、巨浪和小船、老人和鲨鱼的描写给我留下了深刻印象。我第一次去古巴，专程去了海明威当年写《老人与海》的栈桥边。第二次去古巴，我去了海明威经常去的酒吧，点了海明威爱喝的朗姆酒配薄荷叶加冰块。我想体验一下当年海明威写下那些故事时的精神世界和实地氛围。我认为，对不同的文化和文明，我们需要去深入了解。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">The Chinese people have always held American entrepreneurship and creativity in high regards. In my younger years, I read the Federalist Papers and Thomas Paine&rsquo;s Common Sense. I was interested in the life story and thinking of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and other American statesmen. I also read works of Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain and Jack London. I was most captivated by Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s The Old Man and the Sea and its descriptions of howling wind, driving rain, roaring waves, small boat, the old man and sharks. So when I visited Cuba for the first time, I paid a special visit to the breakwater in Cojimar where Hemingway wrote the book. And in my second visit of Cuba, I dropped by the bar Hemingway frequented and ordered a mojito, his favorite rum with mint leaves and ice. I just wanted to feel for myself what was on his mind and what the place was like as he wrote those stories. I believe that it is always important to make an effort to get a deep understanding of the cultures and civilizations that are different from our own.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t在汉字中，&ldquo;人&rdquo;字就是一个相互支撑的形状。中美友好，根基在民众，希望在青年。我愿在此宣布，中方支持未来3年中美两国互派5万名留学生到对方国家学习，中美将在2016年举办&ldquo;中美旅游年&rdquo;。中国将为两国人民友好交往创造更多便利条件。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">The Chinese character Ren or people is in a shape of two strokes supporting each other. The foundation of China-U.S. friendship has its roots in the people, and its future rests with the youth. I wish to announce here that China supports the initiative of sending a total of 50,000 Chinese and American students to study in each other&rsquo;s countries over the next three years. China and the U.S. will launch a China-U.S. Year of Tourism in 2016. China on its part will create more favorable conditions for closer people-to-people exchanges.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t女士们、先生们、朋友们！<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\"></span></div>\n<div>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Ladies and Gentlemen,</span></div>\n<div>\n\tDear Friends,</div>\n<p>\n\t</p>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t基辛格博士在其著作《世界秩序》中说：&ldquo;评判每一代人时，要看他们是否正视了人类社会最宏大和最重要的问题。&rdquo;马丁&middot;路德&middot;金先生也说过：&ldquo;做对的事，任何时机都是好时机。&rdquo;今天，我们再次来到了关键的历史当口。让我们携起手来，共同开创中美关系更加美好的未来，为中美两国人民幸福、为世界各国人民幸福作出更大贡献！</div>\n<div>\n\tDr. Kissinger wrote in his book World Order and I quote, that &ldquo;each generation will be judged by whether the greatest, most consequential issues of the human condition have been faced.&rdquo; And Martin Luther King said, &ldquo;The time is always right to do the right thing.&rdquo; Today, we have come once again to a historical juncture. Let us work together to bring about an even better future for China-U.S. relations and make an even greater contribution to the happiness of our two peoples and the well-being of the people the world over.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t谢谢大家。<span style=\"line-height: 1.8em;\">Thank you.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t<p style=\"font-size: 12px; color: #999999;\">\n\t\t声明：本文系en84网授权沪江网转载。沪江网高度重视知识产权保护，如有不妥之处，欢迎指正。</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div><br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p755778/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p755778\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p755549/\">外媒评选2015年度最性感男人：猜猜他是谁？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p753565/\">胡歌获奖英文演讲惊艳：哪些明星口语爆好</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p755486/\">G20峰会上 习大大语录大爆发</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p755175/\">美到不像话：16岁天才艺术家秋叶上作画</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p755514/\">万万没想到：英语里表达气味的词只有3个！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p754350/\">42种表情的英文表达 一张图搞定！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p755381/\">不想上班怎么破？研究称病假肚子痛最管用</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p754858/\">哪些美国常用语 外国人听了神烦？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p755319/\">谷大白话：怎样才能摆脱字幕看美剧？</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p755316/\">学了这么多年英语，到底怎样才算英语好？</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

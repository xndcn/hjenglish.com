In what ways can people in a family be similar to each other?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tWell, there are many ways that people in a family are similar. One way is that they have the same blood; they are all related to each other physically. I think that the other way they are similar is that they live with each other, so they begin to pick up habits and traits that each other has. They can begin to talk alike and react in the same ways.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>2. Do you think that daughters are always more similar to mothers than to male relatives? What about sons and fathers?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tDaughters and mothers are naturally closer to each other just because they are of the same sex. They just seem to understand each other better than a father would. Of course there are things about their mothers that some daughters do not want to be like, but usually they are able to come to grips with this issue and develop close bonds. A father and a son can be close; a lot depends on how much time a father is able to spend with his son and how much respect they are able to show to each other.<br />\n\tcome to grips with处理，解决<br />\n\tclose bonds亲密的联系</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>3. In terms of personality, are people more influenced by their family or by their friends? In what ways?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tWell, of course people's personalities are influenced first by their families, and then later on, when they are attending school, they are much more influenced by their friends.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong>Genetic research</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>1.Where can people in your country get information about genetic research?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tI suppose, like in most countries, if you want information about anything, the place to look would be on the Internet. You start your search there and see where it takes you. Genetic research is not the kind of thing that you might find at the comer store in any neighborhood.<br />\n\tgenetic research基因研究</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>2.How do people in your country feel about genetic research?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tWell, I don't know so much about this topic, because I am not a scientist or anything, but I suppose that there are pros and cons to this subject. Sometimes when I think of this, I am a little scared and think about mad scientists and Dr. Frankenstein and that kind of stuff. I have heard that there are some good possibilities in this type of research, but off the top of my head the only thing that I can think of is stem cell research. But even that is a bit controversial.<br />\n\tDr. Frankenstein科学怪人<br />\n\tcontroversial有争议的</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>3.Should this research be funded by governments or private companies? Why?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tWell, whoever wants to fund this kind of research should be able to do so at their own discretion. If governments have the money and support from their constituents then they could invest in this research. Now, of course, private companies also have money and could invest in this research, and I should see of no law that would prevent them from doing so.<br />\n\tat their own discretion由他们自己决定<br />\n\tconstituent选民&nbsp;</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p388114/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p388114\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p731795/\">美女们请注意！千万别在简历上附照片！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733807/\">围观：不同年龄的女性对“碧池”的反应</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p732912/\">全球海选：生命中最寻常的幸福小事</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733314/\">娜塔莉波特曼：哈佛演讲中的9道人生课</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733760/\">长江沉船事件：图解海难如何虎口脱险</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733501/\">英雄联盟里的四六级单词 提莫篇</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733614/\">对话霍金：若成为负担 我会考虑安乐死</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733786/\">全美最肥喵星人：体重相当4岁男孩</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733802/\">你们城里人真会玩儿：雷倒老外的神翻译</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p733658/\">画师Brooke：萌萌的小动物 悲伤的事实</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",

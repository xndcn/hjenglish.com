  "description": "<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Just as ...., so</p>\n<p>\n\t　　This is a idiom. Just remember it.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　2. in that vs because - in that is used to talk about some aspects, and because is used to talk about all aspects</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Example :</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Going to Ivy league college is very stressfull because it includes huge expenses.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　means</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Going to Ivy league college is very stressfull in all aspects</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Going to Ivy league college is very stressfull in that it includes huge expenses.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　means</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Going to Ivy league college is very stressfull from economic point of view.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　3.so + adjective/adverb/noun + that + sentence</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Example - So hard that</p>\n<p>\n\t　　so + adjective/adverb/noun + as + infinitive</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Example - So hard as to</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Example :</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Usage - Something is so beautiful that... is preferred over so beautiful is soemthing that...</p>\n<p>\n\t　　4. Although all the shows telecast were not live - It means none of the shows were telecast live</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Although not all the shows were telecast live - It means some of them were telecast live.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　5. such as - Means for example</p>\n<p>\n\t　　6. in order to do - short form is to do</p>\n<p>\n\t　　7. I hate him, for he is a christian - the word for means because</p>\n<p>\n\t　　8. Greater numbers is preferrable to more numbers</p>\n<p>\n\t　　9. usage of so as to and so that</p>\n<p>\n\t　　First, you should know that such + noun + as to is much less common than so + adj/adv + as to.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Now, for the difference between these two. I think these are best illustrated with examples:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Xue Mei spoke in such a way as to calm us down.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The sales materials are presented in such a way as to encourage attendees to purchase the products on the spot.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　These usages focus on doing an action and paying to that action while you are doing it so that the action creates</p>\n<p>\n\t　　a result. To simplify a bit, these usages answer the question, Why did you do it in that way?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　So, the most common words to use with this pattern are way, manner, etc.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Compare these similar sentences:</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Xue Mei spoke so that we would stop asking her questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The sales materials are presented at the end of the meetings so that the participants won&lsquo;t realize the meeting</p>\n<p>\n\t　　is actually a sales presentation.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　The part that comes after so... that... answers the question WHY.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　10. equally well vs as well</p>\n<p>\n\t　　as well - means also</p>\n<p>\n\t　　equally well - is used for comparision.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　11. because is preferrable to Since is preferrable to being</p>\n<p>\n\t　　12. Rather than is (usually) a conjunction, NOT a preposition; instead of is a preposition, NOT a conjunction.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　13. Absolute phrase example</p>\n<p>\n\t　　I chose A, which is the right answer, but I don&lsquo;t really understand why. Is A an absolute phrase?</p>\n<p>\n\t　　For several decades after 1830, Paterson was among the fastest growing cities, its population nearly doubling every ten years.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　a...</p>\n<p>\n\t　　b. with nearly doubled population every ten years.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　c. its population was almost twice as much every ten years.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　d. every ten years its population was almost doubled</p>\n<p>\n\t　　e. almost every ten years population was twice as much</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Paterson was among the fastest growing cities, and its population was nearly doubling every ten years.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　That's the main idea with absolute phrases, since they never include the conjunction or the verb. You should also know that when the -ing form or being is correct, it&lsquo;s because these words are in an absolute phrase;</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Country X saw dramatic increases in many industries, with industry Y being the industry with the greatest increase.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　14 Usage of likelihood</p>\n<p>\n\t　　1. likelihood that something will happen</p>\n<p>\n\t　　2. likelihood of something</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Example</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Likelihood that violence will errupt.</p>\n<p>\n\t　　Likelihood of snowing today is low.</p>\n<br /><center><a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p738653/#relate_articles\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_chat.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/new/p738653\"><img src=\"http://en.hujiang.com/2009/images/rss_digg.jpg\" style=\"border: 0;\" /></a></center><h3 style=\"margin: 10px;\">本周最热文章</h3><ul style=\"margin: 5px 0;\"><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p738002/\">只会Kiss怎么够？英文中的五种亲吻</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p738470/\">世界最成功者13条忠告</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p738401/\">外媒预测：这3部中国影片今夏将火爆影院！</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p735940/\">6个理由你该买件好睡衣</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p737341/\">组图：看自然如何装点被遗忘的时光</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p161331/\">新概念英语第一册Lesson 1  Excuse me</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p532552/\">CC课堂免费在线学：一大波英语课程来袭</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p737762/\">双语美文：会思考的鱼（有声）</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p738338/\">菲律宾男孩路灯下读书 励志照片感动网友</a></li><li style=\"margin: 2px 0 2px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://en.hujiang.com/new/p738578/\">冰岛艺术家：我想用用你的尸体</a></li></ul><div style=\"margin-top: 10px;\">导航:  <a href=\"http://www.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江网</a>  <a href=\"http://www.hjenglish.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江英语</a>  <a href=\"http://jp.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江日语</a>  <a href=\"http://fr.hujiang.com/\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江法语</a>  <a href=\"http://kr.hujiang.com\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" target=\"_black\">沪江韩语</a></div><hr style=\"border: 0.5px solid gray;\" />",
